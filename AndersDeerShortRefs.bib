   abstract = {Ice breakup dates from 1968 to 1988 were examined for 20 Wisconsin lakes to determine whether consistent interannual and long-term changes exist. Each ice record had a trend toward earlier breakup dates, as demonstrated by a negative slope with time, indicating a recent warming trend. The average change in breakup dates was 0.82 d earlier per year for the lakes in southern Wisconsin, which was more extreme than that for the northern Wisconsin lakes (0.45 d yr‒1). Interannual variation in breakup dates was related to the warm phase of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episodes. El Niño events occurred five times during this period (1965, 1972, 1976, 1982, and 1986). Average breakup dates were significantly earlier than average (5–14 d) during the mature phase of El Niño. This variability was affected by the location of the lake: El Niño-related variation was more evident for the southern lakes than the northern lakes. This difference was caused by the average date of breakup for the southern lakes being in late March directly following the period when air temperatures were strongly related to El Niño events, whereas the average dates of breakup of the northern lakes was in mid- to late April following a period when air temperatures were not significantly related to El Niño events. Overall, the interannual and long-term patterns across Wisconsin were relatively consistent, indicating that recent warming and El Niño-related variation are regional climatic responses.},

   abstract = {According to ecological theory, populations whose dynamics are entrained by environmental correlation face increased extinction risk as environmental conditions become more synchronized spatially. This prediction is highly relevant to the study of ecological consequences of climate change. Recent empirical studies have indicated, for example, that large-scale climate synchronizes trophic interactions and population dynamics over broad spatial scales in freshwater and terrestrial systems. Here, we present an analysis of century-scale, spatially replicated data on local weather and the population dynamics of caribou in Greenland. Our results indicate that spatial autocorrelation in local weather has increased with large-scale climatic warming. This increase in spatial synchrony of environmental conditions has been matched, in turn, by an increase in the spatial synchrony of local caribou populations toward the end of the 20th century. Our results indicate that spatial synchrony in environmental conditions and the populations influenced by them are highly variable through time and can increase with climatic warming. We suggest that if future warming can increase population synchrony, it may also increase extinction risk.},

   abstract = {Spatial synchrony, defined as correlated temporal fluctuations among populations, is a fundamental feature of population dynamics, but many aspects of synchrony remain poorly understood. Few studies have examined detailed geographical patterns of synchrony; instead most focus on how synchrony declines with increasing linear distance between locations, making the simplifying assumption that distance decay is isotropic. By synthesising and extending prior work, we show how geography of synchrony, a term which we use to refer to detailed spatial variation in patterns of synchrony, can be leveraged to understand ecological processes including identification of drivers of synchrony, a long-standing challenge. We focus on three main objectives: (1) showing conceptually and theoretically four mechanisms that can generate geographies of synchrony; (2) documenting complex and pronounced geographies of synchrony in two important study systems; and (3) demonstrating a variety of methods capable of revealing the geography of synchrony and, through it, underlying organism ecology. For example, we introduce a new type of network, the synchrony network, the structure of which provides ecological insight. By documenting the importance of geographies of synchrony, advancing conceptual frameworks, and demonstrating powerful methods, we aim to help elevate the geography of synchrony into a mainstream area of study and application.},

North American natural resource management strategies currently depend on hunters and anglers to fund habitat conservation, wildlife management, and land protection through license fees and special taxes on hunting equipment. However, hunter participation is declining across the United States, challenging the long-term viability of this approach. We undertake an age-period-cohort (APC) approach to analyze hunter participation rates and introduce an APC method to project the future number of hunters in Wisconsin. We find that if the recent patterns continue, the number of Wisconsin male deer hunters will decline by more than 10 % (55,304 hunters) in the next 10 years and an additional 18 % (88,552 hunters) between 2020 and 2030.},

   abstract = {We analyzed a unique 51-year time series for a population of mule deer in the North Dakota badlands, USA to examine the effects of seasonal weather on autumn recruitment. Winter weather recorded prior to birth of fawns and weather conditions recorded during spring the previous year (lagged effect), but not during spring or summer after birth, were related to observed patterns in autumn recruitment. When deer density was low (approx. 1 deer/km2) during the 1960s, fawn/female ratios were high ranging from 1.1 to 1.4 when minimum temperatures during the prior winter averaged −16° C and −8° C, respectively. Likewise, during the 2000s, when deer density was high (approx. 3 deer/km2), fawn/female ratios ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 when minimum daily temperatures during the previous winter were −16° C and −8° C, respectively. Large-scale Pacific-based climatic indices (>2,000 km to the Pacific coast) were correlated with local weather and helped explain variability in autumn recruitment. Higher values of the multivariate el niño southern oscillation and Pacific decadal oscillation were correlated with warmer and drier winters in the North Dakota badlands, whereas the North Pacific Index was correlated with colder and snowy winters. The ability to predict recruitment from local weather or from broad-scale climate indices (oscillations) provides greater opportunities for conservation and management, such as adjusting harvest quotas prior to autumn harvest. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.},
