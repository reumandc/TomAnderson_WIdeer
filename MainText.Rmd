##One Sentence Summary#
Winter-climate Moran effects drive synchrony in deer abundances and 
deer-vehicle collisions, thereby influencing associated industries.

#Abstract:
Spatial synchrony of exploited or economically important taxa should have substantial impacts for humans, 
especially as synchrony can produce high-amplitude oscillations across large spatial regions. We investigated 
causes of synchrony in white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*), an exploited species across North America, 
and whether deer synchrony had subsequent impacts on human populations through deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs). We
found that synchronized environmental variation (i.e., Moran effects) over the winter months explained a
substantial fraction of deer synchrony, but only at specific timescales of fluctuations. Synchrony in DVCs were in
turn synchronized by deer populations at the same timescales, indicating that Moran effects cascaded through this
system. This timescale-specific synchrony resulted in large region-wide fluctuations of both deer and DVCs that
would not occur if the synchrony was absent, meaning spatial synchrony can cause local dynamics to sum to a
substantial phenomenon on statewide spatial scales. This study is the first to identify how synchrony in exploited
or economically important taxa can impact humans across large spatial scales. 

#Main Text:
Spatial population synchrony, i.e., the tendency for populations of a species in different locations to exhibit
correlated fluctuations through time, is a ubiquitous phenomenon, documented in hundreds of taxa
[@Leibhold2004_sync]. In theory, synchrony should be important for industries such as hunting and agriculture that
exploit multiple populations
across space because synchrony can markedly influence the strength of temporal variability in the sum of the
populations (Fig. 1A-F) \ref{Fig1_example}. Thus, industries exploiting synchronous taxa should be subject to temporal variability in
yield. Likewise, synchrony of pests or other species with harmful effects may increase the magnitude of
fluctuations in regional total damage caused by the pests [@Allstad2015_gypsysync]. It is well known theoretically that a spatially
synchronous environmental driver can induce population synchrony, called a Moran effect [@Leibhold2004_sync; @Moran1953; @Ranta1997_moran]. But it has
historically been difficult to attribute synchrony in natural populations to specific environmental drivers versus
other potential causes of synchrony such as dispersal [@Kendall2000_moran;@Abbott2007_moran]. Partly for this reason, the real, as opposed to
theoretical, importance of Moran effects for exploited species and their associated industries has rarely been
explored. 

However, recent analytical advances facilitate more precise identification of Moran drivers [@Allstad2015_gypsysync;@Defriez20016_plankton;@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Defriez2017_terrestrial;@Defriez2017_marine,@Sheppard2017_surrogates;@Walter2017_geogsync]. The effectiveness of these tools is due in part to their capacity to decompose synchrony according to the distinct timescales on which it can occur (Fig. 1G-I \ref{Fig1_example}). We here investigate the importance of timescale-specific Moran effects for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) in Wisconsin (WI), USA. White-tailed deer is a species of considerable interest due to its major economic and cultural benefits and impacts on ecosystems [@Cote2004_deerimpacts;@Conover1997_dvc]. Across the USA, US$34$Bn were spent on deer hunting in 2006. In WI, 15% of adults hunt deer [@Winkler2013_hunters], and hunting-related economic activity accounts for ~1% of state GDP (17). DVCs cause an estimated 50 human fatalities and US$1.5Bn in damage to vehicles annually across the USA (18). Thus, it is an important applied question whether environmental synchrony and Moran effects drive some or all of the year-to-year variability in statewide deer abundance and DVC totals, as well as being a case study of a potentially widespread phenomenon. We consider possible Moran effects originating from both environmental drivers and the direct effects of hunting on deer synchrony (i.e., synchrony of hunting activity itself may, a priori, induce observed synchrony in deer populations). We use data from 1981 to 2016 (Fig. S1 \ref{FigS1_Timeseries}) aggregated at two different spatial resolutions, counties and United States Department of Agricultural (USDA) districts (Fig. S2).

Higher values in A, B indicate greater synchrony (A) or phase synchrony (B) at the indicated times and timescales. Contours on (B) indicate statistical significance of phase synchrony at P = 0.001. Horizontal lines in (A) and (B) indicate the timescales that were the focus of statistical analysis (3-7 years). Colors in (C) show synchrony in deer abundance predicted from a wavelet model using snow depth, MEIw, and PDOw as predictors, while contours in (C) show the actual wavelet mean field magnitude of deer abundance from (A), for comparison; agreement is good, giving a visual indication of the statistical result that climatic Moran effects explain deer synchrony.

\caption{Magnitude of the effects of synchrony on state-total deer abundance and DVC fluctuations. Small panels show state-total deer abundance (A) and DVC (B) time series (black lines) and surrogate totals obtained via a randomization procedure (Methods) that eliminates synchrony among counties at 3â€“7-year timescales (grey lines, 1000 lines plotted). Increased variation due to synchrony is particularly notable when trends and long-timescale (longer than 7 years) variability are filtered out by subtracting the mean of the grey lines (large panels). Red arrows highlight example fluctuations that are attributable to synchrony. For DVCs, the typical fluctuation in numbers of DVCs due to synchrony amounts to an estimated difference of US$10-22M in damages statewide (*Methods*). \label{Fig4_StateWideFluctuations}}
