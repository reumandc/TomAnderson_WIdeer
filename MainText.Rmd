**Abstract:** Population cycles are a profound enigma of the natural world, the causes of which have been investigated for over 100 years. An early hypothesized explanation of cycles, for the iconic lynx-hare and for other systems, posited that cyclic environmental phenomena such as sun spots drive population cycles. But that hypothesis was refuted, and for several decades research focused instead on explanations involving nonlinear or delayed density dependence, often via trophic or parasitic interactions. Here we show that timescale-specific environmental effects, by synchronizing local population dynamics on certain timescales only, cause major population cycles over large areas in white-tailed deer and deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs). We thereby demonstrate a new mechanism of cycles that centers once again on environmental influences. The mechanism differs fundamentally from earlier hypotheses that relied on a strongly cyclic driver such as sun spots. An important aspect of the new mechanism is specificity of synchronizing effects to certain timescales, which causes local dynamics to sum across space to a substantial cycle on those timescales. We also demonstrate for the first time that synchrony can be transmitted, in a cascading effect, from environmental drivers, to populations (deer), to human systems (DVCs). Population cycles can influence biodiversity maintenance, ecosystem functioning and services. The cycles we explain can have substantial effects on agriculture, hunting, and accident recovery industries. Research shows that synchrony of some environmental drivers may be changing, possibly as part of climate change. Such changes may alter population cycles that arise via the mechanism described here.

**Correlated fluctuations through time in abundances of distant populations, called spatial synchrony, is 
a widespread and important phenomenon in population ecology [@Leibhold2004_sync]. Synchrony of exploited 
or economically important taxa should, theoretically, have substantial impacts for humans, because
synchrony can produce high-amplitude oscillations through time in total populations across large 
regions. However, synchrony has seldom been investigated empirically for exploited species, 
and its anthropogenic importance is not often considered. Additionally, it has historically been 
difficult to distinguish drivers of synchrony in natural populations of any 
taxa[@Kendall2000_moran;@Abbott2007_moran], though improved analytical methods that decompose 
synchrony by timescale have furthered these 
efforts[@Allstad2015_gypsysync;@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard2017_surrogates;@Walter2017_geogsync]. 
Here we identify the causes of spatial synchrony in the dynamics of populations of white-tailed deer, 
a widely exploited species, and its consequences on deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) across Wisconsin, 
USA. Deer synchrony occurred principally at $3-7$-year timescales of fluctuation, and synchronous 
winter environmental variation explained almost 90% of deer synchrony through a process called the 
Moran effect[@Moran1953;@Ranta1997_moran]. DVCs were in turn synchronized by deer populations. 
Timescale-specific synchrony caused large semi-periodic fluctuations in statewide total deer 
populations and DVCs that would not have occurred without synchrony. Thus synchrony caused local 
dynamics to sum to a major cyclic phenomenon on statewide spatial scales. Our results are 
principally important as a demonstration of a new and potentially widespread mechanism for 
population cycles on large spatial scales, a phenomenon of long-standing interest.**

**Significance Statement:** Understanding the mechanisms behind cycles in population abundances has long been a goal in ecology. Here we demonstrate, in white-tailed deer, a new mechanism by which population cycles can arise, and the consequences of cycles for humans. Fluctuations in deer abundances in different counties of Wisconsin, USA, were highly correlated due to correlated fluctuations in winter climate. Importantly, these synchronized dynamics occurred only on 3-7-year timescales. Deer synchrony in turn produced synchronized oscillations in deer-vehicle collisions across Wisconsin, again with 3-7-year periodicity. When aggregated spatially, fluctuations for individual counties reinforced each other on 3-7-year timescales, producing state-wide cycles. In addition to revealing new mechanisms, our results are important for hunting, insurance industries, and ecosystems influenced by deer.   

#Introductory text

The causes of population cycles have interested and mystified ecologists for over 100 
years [@Myers2018_cycles]. Although early hypotheses, for the 
iconic lynx-hare as well as for other 
systems, proposed that cyclic environmental phenomena such as sun spots drive population 
cycles [@Sinclair1992_sunspots;@Selas2004_sunspots], these hypotheses were robustly
refuted [@Nilssen2007_nosunspots;@Myers2013_nosunspots], and research has since shifted to 
explaining cycles via non-environmental mechanisms based on nonlinear or delayed density 
dependence, often operating through species 
interactions [@Krebs2018_harereview;@Krebs2013_book;@Myers2013_nosunspots;@MartinezPadilla2014_grouse]. 
However, spatial population synchrony, i.e., the tendency for populations of a species in 
different locations to exhibit correlated fluctuations through time, is a 
ubiquitous phenomenon [@Leibhold2004_sync]; and recent work shows that timescale structure 
in synchrony is also common, i.e., synchrony can occur on some timescales of population
dynamics, but be absent on others [@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard2017_surrogates;@Walter2017_geogsync;@Sheppard_wavmodel;@Anderson2019_LO]. 
Furthermore, if synchrony of local populations
occurs on specific timescales, then, in theory, it can produce cycling 
of total populations across large spatial scales (Fig. \ref{Fig1_example}A-F).
Essentially, the synchronous frequency 
components of local time series reinforce each 
other in the total time series, whereas asynchronous components on other 
timescales cancel out when summed. Synchrony is commonly caused by synchronized environmental 
variation, via a process called the Moran effect [@Moran1953]. 
Thus timescale-specific synchrony 
is an unexplored but potentially important mechanism of population cycles
that may help renew interest in environmental causes of cycles.
Timescale-specific synchrony would also be important for industries such as 
hunting and agriculture that exploit multiple populations across space if it 
causes cycling in the sum of the exploited populations, and synchrony 
of pests may likewise produce cycles in regional total damage 
caused by the pests [@Allstad2015_gypsysync]. 

We investigate timescale-specific synchrony and related cycling of white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) and DVCs in Wisconsin (WI), USA. White-tailed deer is a species of considerable interest due to its major economic and cultural benefits and impacts on ecosystems [@Cote2004_deerimpacts;@Conover2011_bookchp]. Across the USA in 2011, US\$$34$Bn were spent on hunting big game, including deer [@usfws2011_survey]. 
In WI, hunting-related economic activity accounts for ~$1\%$ of state GDP [@usfws2011_survey]. DVCs cause about 50 human fatalities and US\$$1.5$Bn in vehicular damage annually across the USA [@Conover2011_bookchp]. Thus it is an important applied question what drives the year-to-year variability in statewide deer abundance and DVC totals. We consider potential drivers of deer populations including both environmental factors and the direct effects of hunting. We use data from 1981-2016 (Supplementary Information Fig.  \ref{SM-FigS1_Timeseries}) aggregated at three spatial resolutions (*Methods*): counties ($n=71$), United States Department of Agricultural (USDA) districts ($n=9$), and statewide (Supplementary Information Fig. \ref{SM-FigS2_map}). 

#Results and Discussion

The wavelet mean field [@Sheppard2016_aphids], a technique for visualizing the strength of synchrony as a
function of time and timescale (*Methods*, Fig \ref{Fig1_example}G-I and Supplementary Information Fig. \ref{SM-PedagogFigWMF} provide examples), revealed that 
the most prominent synchrony in county-level deer abundances occurred at $3-7$-year timescales 
(Fig. \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}A). A related technique, the wavelet phasor mean field (*Methods*, Supplementary Information Fig. \ref{SM-PedagogFigWMF}), 
demonstrated the strong statistical significance of this phenomenon (Fig. \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}B). We
therefore focused our analysis on the $3-7$-year timescale band. Most past analyses of synchrony have
used correlation methods that conflate timescales, but recent results show this can hinder detection of
synchronous phenomena by obscuring important synchrony on some timescales with asynchronous or noisy dynamics on other timescales [@Sheppard2016_aphids]. Moreover, synchrony must be specific to certain timescales to produce cyclic dynamics of
total populations on those timescales (Fig. \ref{Fig1_example}).  

It is well known that a spatially synchronous environmental driver can induce 
population synchrony, called a Moran effect [@Leibhold2004_sync; @Moran1953; 
@Ranta1997_moran]. However, it has historically been 
difficult to attribute synchrony 
in natural populations to specific environmental drivers versus other potential 
causes of synchrony such as dispersal [@Kendall2000_moran;@Abbott2007_moran]. 
Recent analytical advances based on wavelets, used below, can facilitate more precise 
identification of Moran drivers 
[@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard2017_surrogates;@Walter2017_geogsync;@Sheppard_wavmodel]. 
The effectiveness of these tools is due in part to their capacity to decompose 
synchrony according to the distinct timescales on which it can occur (Fig. 
\ref{Fig1_example}G-I).

Spatial wavelet coherence[@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard2017_surrogates] (see Supplementary Information Fig. \ref{SM-PedagogFigSpatCoh} for an example), wavelet regression techniques[@Sheppard_wavmodel], and a wavelet Moran theorem[@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard_wavmodel] (*Methods*) demonstrated that <!--***DAN: Is there a way to get the parens to not appear around the above citations?

deer abundance synchrony on $3-7$-year timescales was principally caused by climatic Moran effects. Synchrony in deer abundance was related to winter snow depth 
(spatial wavelet coherence, $P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Snow Depth" &TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`, Supplementary Information
Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}), in a near anti-phase relationship (mean phase difference between abundance and snow depth across $3-7$-year timescales, in units of ${\pi}$ radians, was $\bar{\theta} =$ `r round(TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Snow Depth"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`; Supplementary Information Fig. \ref{SM-FigS4_PhaseDiffs}D): deer abundances tended to peak in years of below-average snow. This effect probably occurred because deeper snow limits access to winter food resources in ungulates, which subsequently affects body condition, leading to greater susceptibility to starvation or predators and reduced parturition rates [@Mysterud2008_deerclimate;@Hegel2012_caribou]. Deer abundance was also related, with
approximately quarter-cycle phase shifts, 
to the multivariate El Ni$\~{n}$o Southern Oscillation index
($P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter MEI"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`, $\bar{\theta}  =$ `r round(TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter MEI"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`) and to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
($P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter PDO"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`, $\bar{\theta}  =$ `r round(TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter PDO"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`, Supplementary Information Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Fig. \ref{SM-FigS4_PhaseDiffs}A,C), both averaged over the winter months
($\text{Dec}_{t-1}$ to $\text{Mar}_t$, abbreviations $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ and
$\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$). High values of these indices generally correspond to mild winter weather over
WI [@Rodionov2003_elnino]. The two indices were strongly coherent and in-phase with
each other on $3-7$-year timescales over the period 1981-2016 (wavelet coherence, $P =$ `r round(TabS2_results$Pvalue[TabS2_results$Predictor=="Winter MEI" & TabS2_results$Response=="Winter PDO" ],4)`, $\bar{\theta}  =$ `r round(TabS2_results$MeanPhase[TabS2_results$Predictor=="Winter MEI" & TabS2_results$Response=="Winter PDO" ],2)`, Supplementary Information Table \ref{SM-TabS2_PairwiseClimVarSpatCoh}). 
At $5$-yr periodicity, the quarter-cycle phase lags correspond to deer populations
peaking about `r round(-5*TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter PDO"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"]/2,1)` or 
`r round(-5*TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter MEI"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"]/2,1)` years after mild winters, similar to other reported lag times of climatic effects on deer 
populations [@Post1998_popgrowth]. Winter weather and climatic oscillations have been identified previously as mechanisms influencing synchrony in other ungulates across multiple 
regions [@Post2004_greenland;@Grotan2005_roedeer;@Hegel2012_caribou]. Applying the wavelet Moran theorem[@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard_wavmodel] (*Methods*), 
<!--***DAN: I would also like the parens in the citation above to not appear here-->
snow depth, 
$\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$, and $\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$ together explained 
$`r round(abunmodelSyncExp,0)`\%$ of deer synchrony on $3-7$-year timescales. 
See Fig. \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}C for a visual manifestation of this statistical result. 

Snow depth and climate index results seemed to indicate distinct or partly distinct phenomena synchronizing deer on different timescales within the $3-7$-year range. Again applying the wavelet Moran theorem, 
snow depth explained $`r round(usda.snowabunSyncExp3_4,0)`\%$ 
of synchrony in deer abundance
at $3-4$-year timescales when data were aggregated to USDA districts (*Methods*, Supplementary Information Table \ref{SM-TabS4_SummaryDistrict}). Dynamics at $3-4$-year timescales were not well explained by either $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ or $\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$, which instead contributed more
to deer synchrony over $4-7$-year timescales (Supplementary Information Tables \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary} and \ref{SM-TabS4_SummaryDistrict}, Fig. \ref{SM-FigS6_RanksInSurrogs}A). 
$\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ and $\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$ explained $`r round(abunwmeiSyncExp47,)`\%$ and $`r round(abunwpdoSyncExp47,0)`\%$ of deer synchrony on $4-7$-year timescales, respectively (Supplementary Information Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}). Snow depth did not explain $4-7$-year synchrony: spatial wavelet coherence between snow depth and deer abundance on those timescales was non-significant (Supplementary Information Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, \ref{SM-TabS4_SummaryDistrict}).

Deer abundance synchrony was not caused by hunting on $3-7$-year timescales. County-level hunter and deer
abundances were not significantly spatially coherent 
($P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Hunters" & TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`) over $3-7$-year timescales 
(Supplementary Information Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Figs \ref{SM-FigS6_RanksInSurrogs}B, \ref{SM-FigS7_WMFHunter}). 
However, hunter abundances were significantly related to deer abundance on shorter timescales, around 
$2-2.5$-years ($P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Hunters" & TabS1_results$Timescale=="2-2.5"],3)`), and were in approximate anti-phase with deer abundance 
on those timescales ($\bar{\theta}  =$ `r round(TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Hunters" & TabS1_results$Timescale=="2-2.5"],2)`; 
Supplementary Information Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Figs \ref{SM-FigS4_PhaseDiffs}G,
\ref{SM-FigS6_RanksInSurrogs}B). These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that hunters can
regulate deer populations over short timescales but do not do so on longer timescales. The lack of
longer-timescale spatial wavelet coherence between hunters and deer abundance is likely also related to the facts that
hunters prefer to shoot bucks, the removal of which has limited population effects; and the state
regulates antlerless harvest in an attempt to maintain populations at a desirable size.  

Having attributed the bulk of the synchrony in deer abundance at $3-7$-year timescales to climatic Moran 
effects, we also found strong coherence between deer abundance and DVCs on $3-7$-year timescales: Moran 
effects pass from climate to deer to DVCs in a cascading manner, and in this way are ultimately
responsible for synchrony of DVCs. The wavelet mean field and phasor mean field of DVCs revealed time-
and timescale-specific synchrony, and visual patterns were remarkably similar to those shown by deer 
(compare Figs \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}A,B and \ref{Fig3_DvcSync}A,B). Spatial wavelet 
coherence[@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard2017_surrogates] (*Methods*) 
<!--***DAN: Would be nice if we could fix the parens in the above citations-->
showed that deer abundance and DVCs were significantly related 
($P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Response=="DVCs" & TabS1_results$Predictor=="Abundance"],3)`, 
Supplementary Information Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}) on $3-7$-year timescales, and had a nearly in-phase 
relationship ($\bar{\theta} =$ `r round(TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Response=="DVCs" & TabS1_results$Predictor=="Abundance"],2)`, Supplementary Information Fig. \ref{SM-FigS4_PhaseDiffs}E). 
Greater deer abundance almost certainly caused greater DVCs rather 
than DVCs driving deer fluctuations because DVCs were too infrequent to meaningfully impact deer 
abundance (Supplementary Information Fig. \ref{SM-FigS1_Timeseries}), and if they did an anti-phase relationship would have 
been expected. Deer abundance explained $`r round(usda_dvcabunSyncExp,0)`\%$ of the synchrony in 
DVCs when data were aggregated to USDA districts (*Methods*, Supplementary Information Table \ref{SM-TabS4_SummaryDistrict}). 
As a visual manifestation of this statistical result, patterns of synchrony in DVCs predicted by a
wavelet regression model with sole predictor deer abundance match the patterns actually present in DVC
synchrony (Fig. \ref{Fig3_DvcSync}C). 
Statistical significance, phase relationships, and the amount of DVC synchrony explained by deer
abundance remained similar after adjusting DVCs to account for
fluctuations in traffic volume (Supplementary Information Tables \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, \ref{SM-TabS4_SummaryDistrict}, Fig. \ref{SM-FigS4_PhaseDiffs}F).

As mentioned above, timescale-specific synchrony is theoretically important for 
our understanding of population phenomena because it may lead to cyclic 
dynamics in spatial-total or spatial-average time series, which can mean 
alternating relative abundance and scarcity of important species over large areas 
[@Allstad2015_gypsysync]. Our data show the empirical reality of this effect and its 
strength. Statewide oscillations due to synchrony correspond to a typical 
difference of $~ `r round(avgdeerfluc,-4)`$ deer and $~ `r round(avgdvcfluc,-2)`$ 
DVCs between peak and trough years 
(Fig. \ref{Fig4_StateWideFluctuations}). Importantly, these high amplitude 
statewide oscillations in deer and DVCs disappear (Fig. 
\ref{Fig4_StateWideFluctuations}) when synchrony between counties on $3-7$-year 
timescales is removed via a randomization procedure 
(*Methods*); spatial synchrony causes local dynamics to sum to a substantial 
semi-periodic oscillatory phenomenon on statewide spatial scales. Depending on 
assumptions made about costs and reporting rates of DVCs 
[@Huijser2008_dvc;@Marcoux2010_dvc;@Conover2011_bookchp], statewide DVC damages 
vary by US\$$`r floor(round(2*avgdvccostsLow,-6))/1000000`-`r floor(round(2*avgdvccostsHigh,-6))/1000000`$Mn 
between peak and trough years (*Methods*). Similarly, fluctuations of a quarter 
million deer likely have considerable consequences for agricultural crop damage 
and hunting success, both of which can have socioeconomic impacts. See 
Supplementary Information for further details on the cycling mechanism.

Overall, we have demonstrated that timescale-specific Moran effects, by 
synchronizing local dynamics, can cause major population cycles. This new mechanism
differs fundamentally from prior, now refuted hypotheses that population cycles in 
snowshoe hare[@Sinclair1992_sunspots] and moth pests[@Selas2004_sunspots] are due 
to highly regular environmental fluctuations such as 
sun spots because the new mechanism does not require a highly regular environmental
oscillator. Rather it is sufficient simply for an irregular environmental driver 
to be coherent with populations in a timescale band, thereby inducing synchrony
in that band and leading to total-population cycles on the same timescales. 
Timescale specificity in synchrony is 
common[@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard2017_surrogates;@Walter2017_geogsync;@Sheppard_wavmodel]. Resulting cycles affect the exploiting 
industry (hunting) and related industries 
(emergency medicine and accident recovery). We have also 
presented the first demonstration that synchrony can be transmitted in a 
Moran-like effect from ecological to human systems (deer to DVCs). An 
important aspect of all of the phenomena we described is their specificity 
to certain timescales. Recent work on several taxa 
[@Allstad2015_gypsysync;@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Koenig2016_birdsync;@Shestakova2016_forestsync] shows that synchrony of some environmental drivers may be changing, 
possibly due to climate change. These changes may alter population synchrony, 
and therefore also population cycles that arise by our new mechanism. 
In particular, the predicted increase 
in the frequency of strong El Ni$\~{n}$o events 
[@Cai2014_elnino] may lead to altered cycling period in deer 
and DVCs, though our mechanisms are general so we would not 
expect effects to be limited to the system we have studied.

\caption{Theoretical simulation showing that synchrony between populations influences the dynamics of the total population. Panels A-C show
three alternative scenarios for time series measured at 15 locations across a region, and differ in that
populations are unsynchronized (A), or are partially synchronized on short (B, 3-year period) or long (C, 10-year
period) timescales, though synchrony cannot readily be detected visually. Differences in synchrony produce
differences in variability and periodicity of the corresponding spatially summed population time series (D-F
correspond to A-C, respectively). Synchrony on a given timescale produces variability on that timescale in the
total. If time series in A-C were deer populations in 15 locales so that D-F were the total population across the
region, differences among D-F could impact the hunting industry even though local differences across scenarios are
not so noticeable. Differences between D and E are due solely to differences in synchrony. The population at
location $i$ ($i=1,\ldots,15$) and time $t$ was  
$p_i(t) = \sin \left( \frac{2\pi t}{w}+2 \pi u_i \right) + \epsilon_i(t)$, where $w=3$ (A,B) or $10$ (C), 
$u_i = 0$ for all $i$ (B,C) or the $u_i$ are independent draws from a uniform distribution on $(0,1)$ (A), and the $\epsilon_i(t)$ are independent standard-normally distributed. 
Wavelet mean field magnitude plots (\textit{Methods}) computed from A-C (G-I, respectively) 
sensitively reveal the timescale 
structure of synchrony. Higher values mean greater synchrony at the given time on the given timescale.

\caption{Wavelet mean field (A) and wavelet phasor mean field (B) magnitudes, and predicted synchrony (C) 
of deer abundance (\textit{Methods}). Higher values in A, B indicate greater synchrony (A) or phase synchrony (B) 
at the indicated times and timescales. Contours on (B) indicate statistical significance of phase synchrony at 
$P =$ 0.001. Horizontal lines in (A) and (B) indicate the timescales that were the focus of statistical 
analysis, $3-7$-years. Colors on (C) show synchrony in deer abundance predicted from a wavelet model using 
snow depth, $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$, and $\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$ as predictors (\textit{Methods}), while contours in (C) show the 
actual wavelet mean field magnitude of deer abundance from (A), for comparison. Agreement is good, giving a 
visual indication of the statistical result that climatic Moran effects explain deer synchrony.

\caption{Magnitude of the effects of synchrony on state-total deer abundance
and DVC fluctuations. Small panels show state-total deer abundance (A, in millions) and DVC (C, in thousands) time 
series (black lines) and surrogate totals obtained via a randomization procedure 
(\textit{Methods}) that eliminates synchrony among counties at $3-7$-year timescales 
(grey lines, 1000 surrogates plotted). Increased variation and semi-periodic 
oscillations due to synchrony are particularly notable when trends and long-timescale 
(longer than 7 years) variability are filtered out by subtracting the mean of the 
grey lines (B = deer, in thousands; D = DVCs). $\Delta$ represents the difference in values from 
the surrogate mean. Red arrows highlight examples of the strong cycling that is 
attributable to synchrony. For DVCs, the typical fluctuation in numbers of DVCs due 
to synchrony amounts to an estimated difference between peak and trough years of 
US\$$`r floor(round(2*avgdvccostsLow,-6))/1000000`-`r floor(round(2*avgdvccostsHigh,-6))/1000000`$Mn in damages
