##Short title
Synchrony causes population cycles
<!--Limit 40 characters-->

##One Sentence Summary#
Spatial synchrony produces oscillatory dynamics on large spatial scales in deer and deer-vehicle collisions in Wisconsin.

#Abstract:
We investigated causes and consequences of spatial synchrony in the dynamics of populations of white-tailed deer, a
widely exploited species, and in deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) across Wisconsin. Deer synchrony occurred
principally at $3-7$-year timescales of fluctuation, and synchronous winter environmental
variation explained almost 90% of deer synchrony through a process called the Moran effect.
DVCs were in turn synchronized by deer populations: Moran effects cascaded through the system.
Timescale-specific synchrony caused large fluctuations in statewide total deer populations and DVCs that
would not have occurred without synchrony. Thus synchrony caused local dynamics to sum to a major cyclic
phenomenon on statewide spatial scales. Results demonstrate a new way that synchrony in exploited taxa can produce population cycles and impact industries over large areas.

#Main Text:
Spatial population synchrony, i.e., the tendency for populations of a species in different locations to exhibit correlated fluctuations through time, is a ubiquitous phenomenon, documented in hundreds of taxa
[@Leibhold2004_sync]. In theory, synchrony should be important for industries such as hunting and agriculture that exploit multiple populations across space because synchrony can markedly influence the strength of temporal variability in the sum of the populations (Fig. \ref{Fig1_example}A-F). Thus, industries exploiting synchronous taxa should be subject to temporal variability in yield. Likewise, synchrony of pests or other species with harmful effects may increase the magnitude of fluctuations in regional total damage caused by the pests [@Allstad2015_gypsysync]. It is well known theoretically that a spatially synchronous environmental driver can induce population synchrony, called a Moran effect [@Leibhold2004_sync; @Moran1953; @Ranta1997_moran]. However, it has historically been difficult to attribute synchrony in natural populations to specific environmental drivers versus other potential causes of synchrony such as dispersal [@Kendall2000_moran;@Abbott2007_moran]. Partly for this reason, the real, as opposed to theoretical, importance of Moran effects for exploited species and their associated industries has rarely been explored. 

Recent analytical advances facilitate more precise identification of Moran drivers <!---Tom: while we want to promote our own stuff, this might be a place to cut down on a citatoin or two, since we probably don't need 7 citations here--->
<!--***DAN: Agreed, subject to actually needing to cut citations. If we do need to cut citations, I think you could throw out these: @Defriez2016_plankton, @Defriez2017_marine, @Allstad2015_gypsysync, starting with the first of these three and throwing out as many of them as needed-->
[@Allstad2015_gypsysync;@Defriez2016_plankton;@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Defriez2017_terrestrial;@Defriez2017_marine; @Sheppard2017_surrogates;@Walter2017_geogsync]. The effectiveness of these tools is due in part to their capacity to decompose synchrony according to the distinct timescales on which it can occur (Fig. \ref{Fig1_example}G-I). We here investigate the importance of timescale-specific Moran effects for white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) and deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) in Wisconsin (WI), USA. White-tailed deer is a species of considerable interest due to its major economic and cultural benefits and impacts on ecosystems [@Cote2004_deerimpacts;@Conover1997_dvc]. Across the USA, US\$$34$Bn were spent on hunting big game, including deer, in 2011 [@usfws2011_survey]. 
<!--***DAN: Tom, we need a citation for this, please add--><!--***Tom: Done, also adjusted the text to make it slightly more accurate-->
In WI, 15% of adults hunt deer [@Winkler2013_hunters], and hunting-related economic activity accounts for ~$1\%$ of state GDP [@usfws2011_survey]. DVCs cause an estimated 50 human fatalities and US\$$1.5$Bn in damage to vehicles annually across the USA [@Conover2011_bookchp]. Thus, it is an important applied question whether environmental synchrony and Moran effects drive some or all of the year-to-year variability in statewide deer abundance and DVC totals, as well as being a case study of a potentially widespread phenomenon. We consider possible Moran effects originating from both environmental drivers and the direct effects of hunting on deer synchrony (i.e., synchrony of hunting activity itself may, *a priori*, induce observed synchrony in deer populations). We use data from 1981-2016 (Fig.  \ref{SM-FigS1_Timeseries}) aggregated at three spatial resolutions (*Methods*), counties ($n=71$), United States Department of Agricultural (USDA) districts ($n=9$, and statewide (Fig. \ref{SM-FigS2_map}). 

The wavelet mean field [@Sheppard2016_aphids], a technique for visualizing the strength of synchrony as a
function of time and timescale (*Methods*, Figs \ref{Fig1_example}G-I and \ref{SM-PedagogFigWMF} provide examples), revealed that 
the most prominent synchrony in county-level deer abundances occurred at $3-7$-year timescales 
(Fig. \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}A). A related technique, the wavelet phasor mean field (*Methods*, Fig. \ref{SM-PedagogFigWMF}), 
demonstrated the strong statistical significance of this phenomenon (Fig. \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}B). We
therefore focused our analysis on the $3-7$-year timescale band. Most past analyses of synchrony have
used correlation methods that conflate timescales. But recent results show this can hinder detection of
synchronous phenomena by obscuring important synchrony on some timescales with asynchronous or noisy dynamics on other timescales [@Sheppard2016_aphids]. 

Spatial wavelet coherence (See Fig. \ref{SM-PedagogFigSpatCoh} for examples), wavelet regression techniques and a wavelet Moran theorem ([@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard2017_surrogates;@Sheppard_wavmodel]; *Methods*) demonstrated that <!--***DAN: Is there a way to get the parens to not appear around the above citations?

Given we might have to do some post hoc editing on the formatting for Science anyways, we could just manually change it.-->
deer abundance synchrony on $3-7$-year timescales was principally caused by climatic Moran effects. Synchrony in deer abundance was related to winter snow depth 
(spatial wavelet coherence, $P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Snow Depth" &TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`, 
Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}), in a near anti-phase relationship (mean phase difference between abundance and snow depth across $3-7$-year timescales, in units of ${\pi}$ radians, was $\bar{\theta} =$ `r round(TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Snow Depth"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`; Fig. \ref{SM-FigS4_PhaseDiffs}D): deer abundances tended to peak in years of below-average snow. This effect probably occurred because deeper snow limits access to winter food resources in ungulates, which subsequently affects body condition, leading to greater susceptibility to starvation or predators and reduced parturition rates [@Delguidice2008_deersurvival;@Mysterud2008_deerclimate;@Hegel2012_caribou]. Deer abundance was also related to the multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation index
($P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter MEI"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`) and to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation 
($P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter PDO"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`, Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}), both averaged over the winter months
($\text{Dec}_{t-1}$ to $\text{Mar}_t$, abbreviations $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ and
$\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$). High values of these indices generally correspond to mild winter weather over
WI [@Anderson1996_elnino;@Rodionov2003_elnino]. The two indices were strongly coherent and in-phase with
each other on $3-7$-year timescales over the period 1981-2016 (wavelet coherence, $P =$ `r round(TabS2_results$Pvalue[TabS2_results$Predictor=="Winter MEI" & TabS2_results$Response=="Winter PDO" ],4)`, $\bar{\theta}  =$ `r round(TabS2_results$MeanPhase[TabS2_results$Predictor=="Winter MEI" & TabS2_results$Response=="Winter PDO" ],2)`, Table \ref{SM-TabS2_PairwiseClimVarSpatCoh}). 
Both indices showed approximate quarter-cycle phase shifts with deer ($\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$, $\bar{\theta}  =$ `r round(TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter PDO"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`;
$\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$, $\bar{\theta}  =$ `r round(TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter MEI"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`; 
Fig. \ref{SM-FigS4_PhaseDiffs}A,C). At $5$-yr periodicity, these phase lags correspond to deer populations
peaking about `r round(-5*TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter PDO"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"]/2,1)` or 
`r round(-5*TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Winter MEI"&TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"]/2,1)` years after mild winters, similar to other reported lag times of climatic effects on deer 
populations [@Post1998_popgrowth]. Winter weather and climatic oscillations have been identified previously as mechanisms influencing synchrony in other ungulates across multiple 
regions [@Post2004_greenland;@Grotan2005_roedeer;@Hegel2012_caribou]. Applying the wavelet Moran theorem ([@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard_wavmodel]; *Methods*), 
<!--***DAN: I would also like the parens in the citation above to not appear here-->
snow depth, 
$\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$, and $\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$ together explained 
$`r round(abunmodelSyncExp,0)`\%$ of deer synchrony on $3-7$-year timescales. 
See Fig. \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}C for a visual manifestation of this statistical result. 

Snow depth and climate index results seemed to indicate distinct or partly distinct phenomena synchronizing deer on different timescales within the $3-7$-year range. Again applying the wavelet Moran theorem, 
snow depth explained $`r round(usda.snowabunSyncExp3_4,0)`\%$ 
<!--***DAN: Tom, pls make this 47 into a dynamic link - I typed in the value from Table S4 but I would like the correct value to appear via a link--><!--TOM: Done -->
of synchrony in deer abundance
at $3-4$-year timescales when data were aggregated to USDA districts (*Methods*, Table \ref{SM-TabS4_SummaryDistrict}). Dynamics at $3-4$-year timescales were not well explained by either $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ or $\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$, which instead contributed more
to deer synchrony over $4-7$-year timescales (Tables \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary} and \ref{SM-TabS4_SummaryDistrict}, Fig. \ref{SM-FigS6_RanksInSurrogs}A). 
$\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ and $\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$ explained $`r round(abunwmeiSyncExp47,)`\%$ and $`r round(abunwpdoSyncExp47,0)`\%$ of deer synchrony on $4-7$-year timescales, respectively (Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}). Snow depth did not explain $4-7$-year synchrony: spatial wavelet coherence between snow depth and deer abundance on those timescales was non-significant (Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, \ref{SM-TabS4_SummaryDistrict}).

Deer abundance synchrony was not caused by hunting on $3-7$-year timescales. County-level hunter and deer
abundances were not significantly spatially coherent 
($P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Hunters" & TabS1_results$Timescale=="3-7"],2)`) over $3-7$-year timescales 
(Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Figs \ref{SM-FigS6_RanksInSurrogs}B, \ref{SM-FigS7_WMFHunter}). 
However, hunter abundances were significantly related to deer abundance on shorter timescales, around 
$2-2.5$-years ($P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Hunters" & TabS1_results$Timescale=="2-2.5"],3)`), and were in approximate anti-phase with deer abundance 
on those timescales ($\bar{\theta}  =$ `r round(TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Hunters" & TabS1_results$Timescale=="2-2.5"],2)`; 
Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Figs \ref{SM-FigS4_PhaseDiffs}G,
\ref{SM-FigS6_RanksInSurrogs}B). These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that hunters can
regulate deer populations over short timescales but do not do so on longer timescales. The lack of
longer-timescale spatial wavelet coherence between hunters and deer abundance is likely also related to the facts that
hunters prefer to shoot bucks, the removal of which has limited population effects, and the state
regulates antlerless harvest in an attempt to maintain populations at a desirable size.  

Having attributed the bulk of the synchrony in deer abundance at $3-7$-year timescales to climatic Moran 
effects, we also found strong coherence between deer abundance and DVCs on $3-7$-year timescales: Moran 
effects pass from climate to deer to DVCs in a cascading manner, and in this way are ultimately
responsible for synchrony of DVCs. The wavelet mean field and phasor mean field of DVCs revealed time-
and timescale-specific synchrony, and visual patterns were remarkably similar to those shown by deer 
(compare Figs \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}A,B and \ref{Fig3_DvcSync}A,B). Spatial wavelet 
coherence ([@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard2017_surrogates]; *Methods*) 
<!--***DAN: Would be nice if we could fix the parens in the above citations-->
showed that deer abundance and DVCs were significantly related 
($P =$ `r round(TabS1_results$Pvalue[TabS1_results$Response=="DVCs" & TabS1_results$Predictor=="Abundance"],3)`, 
Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}) on $3-7$-year timescales, and had a nearly in-phase 
relationship ($\bar{\theta} =$ `r round(TabS1_results$MeanPhase[TabS1_results$Response=="DVCs" & TabS1_results$Predictor=="Abundance"],2)`, Fig. \ref{SM-FigS4_PhaseDiffs}E). 
Greater deer abundance almost certainly caused greater DVCs rather 
than DVCs driving deer fluctuations because DVCs were too infrequent to meaningfully impact deer 
abundance (Fig. \ref{SM-FigS1_Timeseries}), and if they did an anti-phase relationship would have 
been expected. Deer abundance explained $`r round(usda_dvcabunSyncExp,0)`\%$ of the synchrony in 
DVCs when data were aggregated to USDA districts (*Methods*, Table \ref{SM-TabS4_SummaryDistrict}). 
As a visual manifestation of this statistical result, patterns of synchrony in DVCs predicted by a
wavelet regression model with sole predictor deer abundance match the patterns actually present in DVC
synchrony (Fig. \ref{Fig3_DvcSync}C). 
Statistical significance, phase relationships, and the amount of DVC synchrony explained by deer
abundance remained similar after adjusting DVCs to account for
fluctuations in traffic volume (Tables \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, \ref{SM-TabS4_SummaryDistrict}, Fig. \ref{SM-FigS4_PhaseDiffs}F).

As mentioned above, synchrony is theoretically important for exploited or harmful populations because it may lead to high-amplitude variability in spatial-total or spatial-average time series, which means alternating relative abundance and scarcity of important species over large areas [@Allstad2015_gypsysync]. Our data show the reality of this effect and its strength. Statewide oscillations due to synchrony correspond to a typical difference of $~ `r round(avgdeerfluc,-4)`$ deer and $~ `r round(avgdvcfluc,-2)`$ DVCs between peak and trough years 
(Fig. \ref{Fig4_StateWideFluctuations}). Importantly, these high amplitude statewide oscillations in deer and DVCs disappear (Fig. \ref{Fig4_StateWideFluctuations}) when synchrony between counties on $3-7$-year timescales is removed via a randomization procedure 
(*Methods*); spatial synchrony causes local dynamics to sum to a substantial oscillatory phenomenon on statewide spatial scales. Depending on assumptions made about costs and reporting rates of DVCs [@Huijser2008_dvc;@Marcoux2010_dvc;@Conover2011_bookchp], statewide DVC damages vary by US\$$`r round(2*avgdvccostsLow,-6)`-`r round(2*avgdvccostsHigh,-6)`$ between peak and trough years (*Methods*). Similarly, fluctuations of a quarter million deer likely have considerable consequences for agricultural crop damage and hunting success, both of which can have substantial socioeconomic impacts.

Overall, we have demonstrated that Moran effects, by synchronizing local dynamics, can cause major fluctuations on large spatial scales in an exploited species, thereby affecting the exploiting industry (hunting) and other industries impacted by the species (e.g., emergency-medical and repair industries concerned with DVC recovery). To our knowledge, this is a first demonstration of a new mechanism for population cycles, which have historically been of great interest. We also present the first demonstration that synchrony can be transmitted in a Moran-like effect from ecological to human systems (deer to DVCs). An important aspect of all of the phenomena we observed is their specificity to certain timescales. For economically important taxa, identifying the timescale structure of Moran effects may help predict when periods of relative abundance (outbreaks) [@Allstad2015_gypsysync;@Sheppard2016_aphids] or scarcity (shortages) will occur. Recent research on several taxa [@Allstad2015_gypsysync;@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Defriez2016_plankton;@Koenig2016_birdsync;@Shestakova2016_forestsync] shows that synchrony of some environmental drivers may be changing, possibly as part of global climate change. These changes may alter population synchrony, and our results show the potential for and mechanisms by which such changes could influence human concerns. In particular, the predicted increase in the frequency of strong El Nino events [@Cai2014_elnino] could lead to greater variability in fluctuations of deer and DVCs across WI, though our mechanisms are general so we would not expect effects to be limited to the phenomena we have studied.

\caption{In theory, synchrony between populations influences the dynamics of the total population. Panels A-C show
three alternative scenarios for time series measured at 15 locations across a region, and differ in that
populations are unsynchronized (A), or are partially synchronized on short (B, 3-year period) or long (C, 10-year
period) timescales, though synchrony cannot readily be detected visually. Differences in synchrony produce
differences in variability and periodicity of the corresponding spatially summed population time series (D-F
correspond to A-C, respectively). Synchrony on a given timescale produces variability on that timescale in the
total. If time series in A-C were deer populations in 15 locales so that D-F were the total population across the
region, differences among D-F could impact the hunting industry even though local differences across scenarios are
not so noticeable. Differences between D and E are due solely to differences in synchrony. The population at
location $i$ ($i=1,…,15$) and time $t$ was modelled via 
$p_i(t) = \sin \left( \frac{2\pi t}{w}+2 \pi u_i \right) + \epsilon_i(t)$, where $w=3$ (A,B) or $w=10$ (C), 
$u_i = 0$ for all $i$ (B,C) or the $u_i$ are independent draws from a uniform distribution on $(0,1)$ (A), and the $\epsilon_i(t)$ are independent standard normally distributed.
