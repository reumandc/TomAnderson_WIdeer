##One Sentence Summary#
Winter-climate Moran effects drive synchrony in deer abundances and deer-vehicle collisions, thereby
influencing associated industries.

#Abstract:
Spatial synchrony of exploited or economically important taxa should have substantial impacts for humans,
especially as synchrony can produce high-amplitude oscillations across large spatial regions. We
investigated causes of synchrony in white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*), an exploited species
across North America, and whether deer synchrony had subsequent impacts on human populations through
deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs). We found that synchronized environmental variation (i.e., Moran effects)
over the winter months explained a substantial fraction of deer synchrony, but only at specific
timescales of fluctuations. Synchrony in DVCs were in turn synchronized by deer populations at the same
timescales, indicating that Moran effects cascaded through this system. This timescale-specific synchrony
resulted in large region-wide fluctuations of both deer and DVCs that would not occur if the synchrony
was absent, meaning spatial synchrony can cause local dynamics to sum to a substantial phenomenon on
statewide spatial scales. This study is the first to identify how synchrony in exploited or economically
important taxa can impact humans across large spatial scales. 

#Main Text:
Spatial population synchrony, i.e., the tendency for populations of a species in different locations to exhibit
correlated fluctuations through time, is a ubiquitous phenomenon, documented in hundreds of taxa
[@Leibhold2004_sync]. In theory, synchrony should be important for industries such as hunting and agriculture
that exploit multiple populations across space because synchrony can markedly influence the strength of temporal
variability in the sum of the populations (Fig. \ref{Fig1_example}A-F). Thus, industries exploiting synchronous
taxa should be subject to temporal variability in yield. Likewise, synchrony of pests or other species with
harmful effects may increase the magnitude of fluctuations in regional total damage caused by the pests
[@Allstad2015_gypsysync]. It is well known theoretically that a spatially synchronous environmental driver can
induce population synchrony, called a Moran effect [@Leibhold2004_sync; @Moran1953; @Ranta1997_moran]. But it has
historically been difficult to attribute synchrony in natural populations to specific environmental drivers
versus other potential causes of synchrony such as dispersal [@Kendall2000_moran;@Abbott2007_moran]. Partly for
this reason, the real, as opposed to theoretical, importance of Moran effects for exploited species and their
associated industries has rarely been explored. 

However, recent analytical advances facilitate more precise identification of Moran drivers
[@Allstad2015_gypsysync;@Defriez2016_plankton;@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Defriez2017_terrestrial;@Defriez2017_marine,
@Sheppard2017_surrogates;@Walter2017_geogsync]. The effectiveness of these tools is due in part to their capacity
to decompose synchrony according to the distinct timescales on which it can occur (Fig. \ref{Fig1_example}G-I).
We here investigate the importance of timescale-specific Moran effects for white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) and deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) in Wisconsin (WI), USA. White-tailed deer is a species of considerable interest due to its major economic and cultural benefits and impacts on ecosystems [@Cote2004_deerimpacts;@Conover1997_dvc]. Across the USA, US\$$34$Bn were spent on deer hunting in 2006. In WI, 15% of adults hunt deer [@Winkler2013_hunters], and hunting-related economic activity accounts for ~$1\%$ of state GDP [@usfws2011_survey] DVCs cause an estimated 50 human fatalities and US\$$1.5$Bn in damage to vehicles annually across the USA [@Conover2011_bookchp] Thus, it is an important applied question whether environmental synchrony and Moran effects drive some or all of the year-to-year variability in statewide deer abundance and DVC totals, as well as being a case study of a potentially widespread phenomenon. We consider possible Moran effects originating from both environmental drivers and the direct effects of hunting on deer synchrony (i.e., synchrony of hunting activity itself may, a priori, induce observed synchrony in deer populations). We use data from 1981-2016 (Fig.  \ref{SM-FigS1_Timeseries}) aggregated at two different spatial resolutions, counties and United States Department of Agricultural (USDA) districts (Fig. \ref{SM-FigS2_map}). 

The wavelet mean field [@Sheppard2016_aphids], a technique for visualizing the strength of synchrony as a
function of time and timescale (*Methods*), revealed that the most prominent synchrony in county-level deer abundances occurred at $3-7$-year timescales (Fig. \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}A). A related technique, the wavelet phasor mean field (*Methods*), demonstrated the strong statistical significance of this phenomenon (Fig. \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}B). We therefore focused our analysis on the $3-7$-year timescale band. Most past analyses of synchrony have used correlation methods that conflate timescales. But recent results show this can hinder detection of synchronous phenomena by obscuring important synchrony on some timescales with asynchronous or noisy dynamics on other timescales [@Sheppard2016_aphids]. Spatial wavelet coherence, wavelet regression techniques and a wavelet Moran theorem ([@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard2017_surrogates;@Sheppard_wavmodel]; *Methods*) demonstrated that deer abundance synchrony on $3-7$-year timescales was principally caused by climatic Moran effects. Synchrony in deer abundance was related to winter snow depth ($P =$ `r TabS1_results$P.value[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Snwd"]`; Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}), in a near anti-phase relationship (mean phase difference between abundance and snow depth across $3-7$-year timescales, in units of ${\pi}$ radians: $\bar{\theta} =$ `r TabS1_results$Mean.Phase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Snwd"]`; Fig. \ref{SM-FigS3_PhaseDiffs}): deer abundances tended to peak in years of below-average snow. This effect probably occurs because deeper snow limits access to winter food resources in ungulates, which subsequently affects body condition, leading to greater susceptibility to starvation or predators and reduced parturtion rates
[@Delguidice2008_deersurvival;@Mysterud2008_deerclimate;@Hegel2012_caribou]. Deer abundance was
also related to the multivariate El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation index ($P =$ `r TabS1_results$P.value[TabS1_results$Predictor=="WinterMEI"]`) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation ($P =$ `r TabS1_results$P.value[TabS1_results$Predictor=="WinterPDO"]`; Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}), both averaged over the winter months ($\text{Dec}_{t-1}$ to $\text{Mar}_t$; abbreviations MEIw and PDOw). High values of these indices generally correspond to mild winter weather over WI [@Anderson1996_elnino;@Rodionov2003_elnino]. The two indices were strongly coherent and in-phase with each other on $3-7$-year timescales over the period 1981-2016 ($P =$ `r TabS2_results["WinterMEI","WinterPDO"]`; $\bar{\theta}  =$ 0.01, Table \ref{SM-TabS2_PairwiseClimVarSpatCoh}). Both indices showed approximate quarter-cycle phase shifts with deer (PDOw: $\bar{\theta}  =$ `r TabS1_results$Mean.Phase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="WinterPDO"]`; MEIw: $\bar{\theta}  =$ `r TabS1_results$Mean.Phase[TabS1_results$Predictor=="WinterMEI"]`; Fig. \ref{SM-FigS3_PhaseDiffs}). At $5$-yr periodicity, these phase lags correspond to deer populations
peaking about $1.4$ years after mild winters, similar to other reported lag times of climatic effects on deer populations [@Post1998_popgrowth]. Winter weather and climatic oscillations have been identified previously as mechanisms influencing ungulate dynamics across multiple regions
[@Post2004_greenland;@Grotan2005_roedeer;@Hegel2012_caribou].

Snow depth and climate index results seemed to indicate distinct or partly distinct phenomena synchronizing deer on different timescales within the $3-7$-year range. Snow depth explained $`r round(100*snowabunSyncExp3_5,0)`\%$ of synchrony in deer abundance
at $3-5$-year timescales (Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Fig. \ref{SM-FigS4_RanksInSurrogs}).
Dynamics at $3-5$-year timescales were not well explained by either MEIw or PDOw, which instead contributed more
to deer synchrony over $4-7$-year timescales (Fig. \ref{SM-FigS4_RanksInSurrogs}). MEIw and PDOw explained $`r round(100*abunwmeiSyncExp,)`\%$ and $`r round(100*abunwpdoSyncExp,0)`\%$ of deer synchrony on $3-7$-year timescales, respectively, but snow depth, MEIw, and PDOw together explained $`r round(100*abunmodelSyncExp,0)`\%$ of deer synchrony on those timescales (Fig. \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}C). 

Deer abundance synchrony was not caused by hunting on $3-7$-year timescales. County-level hunter and deer abundances were not significantly spatially coherent ($P =$ `r TabS1_results$P.value[TabS1_results$Predictor=="Hunters"]`) over $3-7$-year timescales (Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Figs \ref{SM-FigS4_RanksInSurrogs}, \ref{SM-FigS5_WMFHunter}). However, hunter abundances were significantly related to deer abundance on shorter timescales, around $2-2.5$-years ($P =$ `r round(hunterabunPVal2_2.5,3)`), and were in approximate anti-phase with deer abundance on those timescales ($\bar{\theta}  =$ `r round(hunterabunphase2_2.5,2)`; Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Figs \ref{SM-FigS3_PhaseDiffs},\ref{SM-FigS4_RanksInSurrogs}). These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that hunters can regulate deer populations over short timescales but do not do so across longer time periods. The lack of longer-timescale coherence between hunters and deer abundance is likely also related to the facts that hunters prefer to shoot bucks, the removal of which can have limited population effects, and the state regulates antlerless harvest in an attempt to maintain populations at a desirable size.  

Having attributed the bulk of the synchrony in deer abundance at $3-7$-year timescales to climatic Moran effects, we also found strong coherence between deer abundance and DVCs on $3-7$-year timescales: Moran effects pass from climate to deer to DVCs in a cascading manner, and in this way are ultimately responsible for synchrony of DVCs. The wavelet mean field and phasor mean field of DVCs revealed time- and timescale-specific synchrony, and patterns were remarkably similar to those shown by deer (compare Figs \ref{Fig2_DeerSync}A,B and \ref{Fig3_DvcSync}A,B). Spatial wavelet coherence [@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard2017_surrogates; *Methods*] showed deer abundance and DVCs were significantly related ($P =$ `r TabS1_results$P.value[TabS1_results$Response=="DVCs" & TabS1_results$Predictor=="Abundance"]`, Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}) on $3-7$-year timescales, and had a nearly in-phase relationship ($\bar{\theta} =$ `r TabS1_results$Mean.Phase[TabS1_results$Response=="DVCs" & TabS1_results$Predictor=="Abundance"]`, Fig. \ref{SM-FigS3_PhaseDiffs}). Greater deer abundance almost certainly caused greater DVCs rather than DVCs driving deer fluctuations because DVCs were too infrequent to meaningfully impact deer abundance (Fig. \ref{SM-FigS1_Timeseries}), and if they did an anti-phase relationship would have been expected. Deer abundance explained $`r round(100*usda_dvcabunSyncExp,0)`\%$ of the synchrony in DVCs when data were aggregated to USDA districts (*Methods*). As a visual manifestation of this statistical result, patterns of synchrony in DVCs predicted by a wavelet regression model with sole predictor deer abundance match the patterns actually present in DVC synchrony (Fig. \ref{Fig3_DvcSync}C). Statistical significance, phase relationships, and the amount of synchrony explained between abundance and DVCs ($`r round(100*usda_adjdvcabunSyncExp,0)`\%$) remained similar after accounting for fluctuations in traffic volume (Table \ref{SM-TabS1_CountyCoherenceSummary}).

As mentioned above, synchrony is theoretically important for exploited or harmful populations because it leads to high-amplitude variability in spatial-total or spatial-average time series, which means alternating relative abundance and scarcity of economically important species over large areas [@Allstad2015_gypsysync]. Our data show the reality of this effect and its strength. Statewide oscillations due to synchrony correspond to an average difference of $>`r round(avgdeerfluc,-4)`$ deer and $> `r round(avgdvcfluc,-2)`$ DVCs between peak and trough years 
(Fig. \ref{Fig4_StateWideFluctuations}). Importantly, these high amplitude statewide oscillations in deer and DVCs disappear when synchrony between counties on $3-7$-year timescales is removed via a randomization procedure 
(Fig. \ref{Fig4_StateWideFluctuations}; *Methods*); spatial synchrony causes local dynamics to sum to a substantial phenomenon on statewide spatial scales. Depending on assumptions made about costs and reporting rates of DVCs [@Huijser2008_dvc;@Marcoux2010_dvc;@Conover2011_bookchp], statewide DVC damages vary by US\$$`r round(2*avgdvccostsLow,-6)`-`r round(2*avgdvccostsHigh,-6)`$ between peak and trough years (*Methods*). Similarly, fluctuations of a quarter million deer likely have considerable consequences for agricultural crop damage and hunting success, both of which can have high socioeconomic impacts.

Overall, we have demonstrated that Moran effects, by synchronizing local dynamics, can cause major fluctuations on large spatial scales in an exploited species, thereby affecting the exploiting industry (hunting) and other industries impacted by the species (e.g., emergency-medical and repair industries concerned with DVC recovery). We also present what is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that synchrony can be transmitted in a Moran-like effect from ecological to human systems (deer to DVCs). An important aspect of all of the phenomena we observed is their specificity to certain timescales. For economically important taxa, identifying the timescale structure of Moran effects may help predict when periods of relative abundance (outbreaks) [@Allstad2015_gypsysync;@Sheppard2016_aphids] or scarcity (shortages) will occur. Recent research on several taxa [@Allstad2015_gypsysync;@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Defriez2016_plankton;@Koenig2016_birdsync;@Shestakova2016_forestsync] shows that synchrony of some environmental drivers may be changing, possibly as part of global climate change. These changes may alter population synchrony, and our results show the potential for and mechanisms by which such changes could influence human concerns. In particular, the predicted increase in the frequency of strong El NiÃ±o events [@Cai2014_elnino] could lead to greater variability in fluctuations of deer and DVCs across WI, though our mechanisms are general so we would not expect effects to be limited to the phenomena we have studied.

three alternative scenarios for time series measured at 15 locations across a region, and differ in that
populations are unsynchronized (A), or are partially synchronized on short (B; 3-year period) or long (C; 10-year
period) timescales, though synchrony cannot readily be detected visually. Differences in synchrony produce
differences in variability and periodicity of the corresponding spatially summed population time series (D-F
correspond to A-C, respectively). Synchrony on a given timescale produces variability on that timescale in the
total. If time series in A-C were deer populations in 15 locales so that D-F were the total population across the
region, differences among D-F could impact the hunting industry even though local difference across scenarios are
not so noticeable. Difference between D and E are due solely to differences in synchrony. The population at
location $i$ ($i=1,â¦,15$) and time $t$ was modelled via $p_i(t) = sin \left( \frac{2\pi t}{w}+2 \pi\mu_i\right) + \epsilon_i(t)$ where $w=3$ (A,B), or $w=3$ (C), $\mu_i = 0$ for all $i$ (B,C) or the $\mu_i$ are independent draws from a uniformly distribution on (0,1) (A). Wavelet mean field magnitude plots (\textit{Methods}) computed from A-C (G-I) sensitively reveal the timescale structure of synchrony. Higher values mean greater synchrony at the given time on the given timescale.
