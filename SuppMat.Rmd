#Clean population data: end result are two lists of matrices called "cty.list" and "usda.list". Cty stands for county. All elements of cty.list are matrices, counties (rows) by year (columns). Elements are named Abun (abundance), Crashes (DVCs), Traffic (traffic), and AdjDVC (Traffic-adjusted DVCs). USDA stands for USDA districts, and all elements in "usda.list" are matrices, districts (rows) by year (columns) and named similarly to cty.list. In both lists, the data sets were complete in spatial dimension but varied in temporal dimension: deer span the years 1981-2016, Crashes 1987-2016 and Traffice/AdjDVCs 1988-2016. Missing years are filled with NAs. Both objects are saved as .rds files in the Results folder. These data sets are also used to generate state-level (single time series) data for deer abundance, DVCs, and hunter numbers.

#Clean winter weather and climate data: end results are four lists of matrices called "winter.clim", climindex, winter.clim.usda, and climindex.usda. "winter.clim"" includes matrices, counties (rows) by year (columns) that are the averages of NOAA weather station data from Dec[t-1] to Mar[t], with named elements of Tmin (minimum temperature), Tmax (maximum temperature), Prcp (precipitation), and Snwd(snow depth). Not all counties had weather data in all years and are filled with NAs where missing. "winter.clim.usda"" are matrices, districts (rows) by year (columns) and includes the same variables and variable names as "winter.clim"" but averaged over USDA districts (~ 7 counties per district) and are complete in both dimensions. All objects are saved as .rds files in the Results folder."climindex" and "climindex.usda" are matrices of climate indices averaged over winter (Dec[t-1]-Mar[t]) and summer (Apr[t]-Nov[t]). Values in each matrices are repeated across rows because the climate indices are not a spatial variable. The dimensions of each match the spatial dimensions of other county (climindex) or district (climindex.usda) data sets. These data sets are also used to generate state-level (single time series) data for snow depth and climate indices.

# Theory \label{SI:theory}

\subsection{Model and main theorem}\label{SI:theory:modeltheorem}
\noindent We start by specifying the general model we consider. 
The model is similar to those used in the supplementary information of 
@Desharnais2018, but in
contrast to their models, our model
considers more than two habitat patches and does not consider dispersal.
Due to the similarity in models, some of our below sentences describing our model 
are copied 
with very little or no change in wording
from that reference.
Suppose population dynamics are given by
\begin{equation}
w_{i} = b_1 w_i(t-1)+ \cdots + b_n w_i(t-n)+p_0 \epsilon_{i}(t)+\cdots+p_{m}\epsilon_{i}(t-m),\label{eq:mainmodel}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $w_{i}(t)$ is the deviation of a population index $x_{i}(t)$ in
habitat patch $i$ ($i=1,\ldots,N$) at time $t$ from an equilibrium value $x_{i}^{*}$. 
The environmental noise process $\epsilon=(\epsilon_{1},\ldots,\epsilon_{N})$
is assumed to be a second-order stationary stochastic process with $\E(\epsilon_{i})=0$
for all $i$. Without loss of generality, $b_n \neq 0$ and $p_m \neq 0$. We also assume
the complex roots of the polynomial $1-b_1 z - b_2 z^2 - \cdots - b_n z^n=0$
have modulus greater than one. This assumption is a necessary and sufficient condition 
for stability of the equilibrium of the general model of which (\ref{eq:mainmodel})
is a linearization (@Desharnais2018, their supplementary information section 1.2) 
and also for the existence of a stationary
stochastic process that is a solution of (\ref{eq:mainmodel}) 
[@Desharnais2018; @Brillinger2001]. 
We denote by $x_{\text{tot}}(t)$ the total population $\sum_{i=1}^N x_i(t)$,
which has the same characteristics of variability through time 
as $w_{\text{tot}}(t)=\sum_{i=1}^N w_i(t)$.

To develop our theory, we need the language and fundamental mathematical results of
stochastic processes and their spectra and cross spectra. 
Spectral statistics are extremely well-developed, widely known, and widely applied in numerous fields;
background on spectral statistics can be found from many sources [@Reinsel1997; @Shumway2000;@Brillinger2001]. We here define notation. 
Let $S_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{i}}(f)$
denote the power spectrum of the process $\epsilon_{i}$ and let $S_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}(f)$
denote the cross spectrum of the processes $\epsilon_{i}$ and $\epsilon_{j}$.
Here $f$ is the frequency of a periodic oscillation, the reciprocal of its period 
(i.e., its timescale). Throughout, we use, for units of $f$, cycles per time interval between 
population sampling events, and we consider $f$ between $0$ and $0.5$ (the Nyquist frequency). 
This is the range of frequencies
about which sampled data provide any information. 
The cospectrum, denoted $C_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}(f)$, is $\Rp(S_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}(f))$, 
the real part. Analogously, let $S_{w_i w_i}(f)$,
$S_{w_i w_j}(f)$ and $C_{w_i w_j}(f)=\Rp(S_{w_i w_j}(f))$ be the spectrum, cross spectrum
and cospectrum of the population processes $w_i$ and $w_j$.
Given a multivariate process such as $\epsilon=(\epsilon_1,\ldots,\epsilon_N)$ or
$w=(w_1,\ldots,w_N)$, the spectral matrix of the process is denoted
$S_{\epsilon \epsilon}(f)$ or $S_{ww}(f)$. The spectral matrix, an $N \times N$ matrix-valued function
of frequency, has the spectra
$S_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_i}(f)$ on the diagonal and the cross spectra $S_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_j}(f)$ 
in the off-diagonal. The special notation $S_{\text{tot}}(f)$ is used for 
the spectrum of $w_{\text{tot}}$ (which is the same as the spectrum of $x_{\text{tot}}$).

The main theoretical result is as follows.

\begin{thm}
Let $\mu=\exp(-2\pi \iota f)$, where $\iota$ (the Greek letter iota) is the imaginary unit, 
and define $\gamma=p_{ 0}+p_{ 1}\mu+\cdots+p_{m}\mu^{m}$ and
$\lambda=b_{ 1 }\mu+b_{ 2}\mu^{2}+\cdots+b_{n}\mu^{n}$ in terms of $\mu$ and the 
coefficients of the population model. Then
$S_{\text{\emph{tot}}} = \left| \frac{\gamma}{1-\lambda} \right|^{ 2} \left[ \sum_i S_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{i}} +\sum_{i \neq j} C_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}\right]$.
\label{prop:mainthm}
\end{thm}
\noindent The proof is in section \ref{sect:mainproof}.
Thus the power spectrum of the total population, which tells us whether and how the 
total population time series cycles, is influenced by three terms.
First, $\left| \frac{\gamma}{1-\lambda} \right|^{ 2}$, which reflects the nature of
dynamics intrinsic to the population ($\gamma$ and $\lambda$ are determined by
the model coefficients $b_1,\ldots,b_n$ and $p_0,\ldots,p_m$). This is the quantity 
denoted $F_{\text{popdyn}}(f)$ in the main text. Second,
$\sum_i S_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{i}}$, the  sum of the power
spectra of the environmental noise time series, which reflects the extent to which the noise
itself may be periodic. And third, $\sum_{i \neq j} C_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}$,
the sum of the cospectra of the noise, which reflects the extent to which noise
synchrony across locations may be specific to certain timescales.

Crucially, the first sum, $\sum_i S_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{i}}$, 
is of $N$ quantities and the
second sum, $\sum_{i \neq j} C_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}$, is of $N^2 - N$ quantities. 
This suggests that, when $N$ is large enough, timescale specificity of
synchrony of noise across locations ($N^2-N$ terms) will tend to be more important 
for $S_{\text{tot}}$ than the nature of the periodicity of the noise ($N$ terms).
Of course, whether this intuition is actually true depends on the specific values of 
the terms in each sum. But if N is, say, $71$ (there are $71$ counties in Wisconsin
for which deer data were available), then $4970=N^2-N \gg N=71$, so $N^2-N$ is larger
than $N$ by around 2 orders of magnitude. Thus the term
$\sum_{i \neq j} C_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}$ will make a much bigger contribution
to $S_{\text{tot}}$ than will the term $\sum_i S_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{i}}$ unless
cospectra are correspondingly smaller than spectra, on average, by around 2 orders
of magnitude. The following three examples make clear the overwhelming importance 
of synchrony for cycling of the spatial-total population.

\subsection{Example 1} \label{SI:theory:example1}
\noindent For example 1, we constrasted a case for which
environmental noise was asynchronous with a case for which environmental noise
had timescale-specific synchrony to show that, in the latter case, cycling
of the regional-total population was much more noticable. The nature
of population dynamics and the local statistical characteristics of environmental 
noise were kept fixed across the two cases.

For example 1, we considered $N=70$ sampling locations (likewise
for subsequent examples).
The environmental noise processes, $\epsilon_i(t)$ were constructed so that the power spectrum
of noise at each location was 
$S_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_i} = \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2$ and
the cross spectrum between any two locations was 
$S_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_j}=\rho \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2$, for $c_1=0$ and $c_2=-1/9$.
The function of frequency $\left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2$
has a single peak at a frequency of $0.25$ cycles per sampling interval (corresponding to
a period of 4 sampling intervals) for the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$ used, 
so the spectra $S_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_i}$
indicate environmental noise that tends to oscillate with a period of $4$ years.
See below for the precise means by which environmental noise was constructed.

We considered two cases within theoretical example 1. For case 1, we used
$\rho=0.8$ and for case 2 we used $\rho=0$. Thus for case 1, noise was 
synchronous between locations (cospectra between locations were not zero), 
and this synchrony was dominated by a timescale of 4 years (cospectra
had a peak at a frequency corresponding to that period). For case 2,
noise time series in different sampling locations were unrelated (cospectra
were 0), though spectra were the same as case 1. Analytically calculated 
noise spectra and estimates based on simulations are in Fig. 
\ref{TheoryExample1}A-B; likewise, for cospectra, see Fig. \ref{TheoryExample1}C-D.

For cases 1 and 2 of example 1 and for all cases of all
subsequent theoretical examples, population dynamics were governed
in all sampling locations by an AR(1) process, i.e., $n=1$ and $m=0$ in 
equation (\ref{eq:mainmodel}). In all examples and cases we used $b_1=0.15$ and $p_0=1$.
An AR(1) population model ensures that populations are not intrinsically 
cyclic in any sense, so any periodicity that arises comes ultimately
from the environmental noise and its synchrony.

Applying the theorem, 
\begin{equation}
S_{\text{tot}} = \left| \frac{1}{1-b_1 \mu} \right|^2
\left|\frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu - c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2
\left[N + (N^2-N)\rho \right].
\end{equation}
\noindent The first factor here, $\left| \frac{1}{1-b_1 \mu} \right|^2$,
captures the influence of population dynamics on $S_{\text{tot}}$.
The second term is the factor common to the sums $\sum_i S_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{i}}$
and $\sum_{i \neq j} C_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}$ in the expression of 
theorem \ref{prop:mainthm}. The third term shows the relative contributions
of periodicity in noise time series ($N$) and 
synchrony between noise time series in different locations 
($(N^2-N)\rho$). Unless $\rho$ is very small, the contribution of
synchrony will be much larger. In case 1, for which we used 
$\rho=0.8$, the contribution of synchrony to $S_{\text{tot}}$
dwarfs the contribution due directly to periodicity of the noise
($N=70$ and $(N^2-N)\rho=3864$).
In case 2, for which we used $\rho=0$, there is no synchrony, and as
a result the total power of $w_{\text{tot}}$ (equal to an integral of
$S_{\text{tot}}$) is very small. $S_{\text{tot}}$ is plotted for
cases 1 and 2, respectively, in Fig. \ref{TheoryExample1}E-F. The much greater
power and periodicity in $w_{\text{tot}}$ can be seen in example time 
series, as well (Fig. \ref{TheoryExample1}G-H).

Noise for example 1 was generated via an AR(2) process. Let 
$\delta(t) = (\delta_1(t),\ldots,\delta_N(t))$ be drawn, independently for 
each time, $t$, from a multivariate normal distribution with mean $(0,\ldots,0)$
and covariance matrix consisting of entries $\rho$ in the off diagonal and $1$
in the diagonal. Let $\epsilon_i(t)=c_1 \epsilon_i(t-1) + c_2 \epsilon_i(t-2)+\delta_i(t)$.
Theorem \ref{thm:lem} in SI section \ref{sect:mainproof} provides the spectra
and cross spectra of the noise process $\epsilon$ which are stated above.

\subsection{Example 2} \label{SI:theory:example2} 
\noindent For example 2, we contrasted a case in which
the synchrony of environmental noise was not timescale specific, with a case
for which it was, to show that timescale specificity of environmental synchrony
is what produces cycling in the regional-total population. The nature
of population dynamics and the local statistical characteristics of environmental 
noise were again kept fixed across the two cases, as was the total (across
all timescales) synchrony of environmental noise.

For example 2, the environmental noise processes 
$\epsilon_i(t)$ were constructed so that the power spectrum
of noise at each location was 
$S_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_i} = \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2+1$ and
the cross spectrum between any two locations was 
$S_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_j}=\rho_1 \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2+\rho_2$ 
for $c_1=0$ and $c_2=-4/9$. For these values of $c_1$ and $c_2$, 
the function of frequency $\left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2$
again has a single peak at frenqency $0.25$ cycles per sampling interval
(corresponding to an oscillatory period of 4 sampling intervals). 
See below for the precise means by which environmental noise was constructed.

We again considered two cases. For case 1, $\rho_1=0$ and $\rho_2=0.8$,
so cospectra were flat and synchrony was nonzero but was also not 
timescale-specific. For case 2, $\rho_2$ was set to $0$ and $\rho_1$ was chosen 
so that covariances between locations were the same, in expectation, as 
they were in case 1. Because the expected covariance between environmental 
noise time series at locations $i$ and $j$ can be obtained from the 
cospectrum $C_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}=S_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}$ via integration, 
$\int_{-1/2}^{1/2} S_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}(f) df$, this was accomplished 
by choosing $\rho_1$ so that 
$\int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \rho_1 \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2 df
= \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} 0.8 df = 0.8$. Thus, for case 2,
$\rho_1 = \frac{0.8}{\int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2 df}$. 
This was calculated numerically, and equals approximately $0.64$.
Thus environmental synchrony has the same overall strength (location-to-location covariances
were the same) in the two cases, but synchrony was specific to timescales around 4 sampling
intervals for case 2 and was equal across all timescales for case 1.
Analytically calculated 
noise spectra and estimates based on simulations are in Fig. 
\ref{TheoryExample2}A-B; likewise, for cospectra, see Fig. \ref{TheoryExample2}C-D.

Applying the theorem, 
\begin{equation}
S_{\text{tot}} = \left| \frac{1}{1-b_1 \mu} \right|^2
\left[(N^2-N)\left( \rho_1 \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2+\rho_2 \right)+N\left( \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2+1 \right)\right].\label{eq:stotexamp2}
\end{equation}
\noindent In case 1, this is
\begin{equation}
S_{\text{tot}} = \left| \frac{1}{1-b_1 \mu} \right|^2
\left[(N^2-N)\rho_2+N\left( \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2+1 \right)\right].
\end{equation}
\noindent Because $N^2-N \gg N$, the dominant term inside the hard brackets is the first term,
which is not peaked as a function of frequency. So $S_{\text{tot}}$ will not be peaked, i.e., in case 1
the total population is non-periodic. Recall that case 1 is the case 
in which synchrony was not timescale specific. In case 2, equation (\ref{eq:stotexamp2})
becomes 
\begin{equation}
S_{\text{tot}} = \left| \frac{1}{1-b_1 \mu} \right|^2
\left[(N^2-N)\left( \rho_1 \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2 \right)+N\left( \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1 \mu -c_2 \mu^2} \right|^2+1 \right)\right].
\end{equation}
\noindent The dominant term inside the hard brackets is now peaked as a function of 
frequency, so $S_{\text{tot}}$ will 
be peaked, i.e., the total population is periodic. Recall that case 2
is the case in which synchrony was timescale specific. 
So it is the peakedness (or not) of synchrony that influences whether 
$S_{\text{tot}}$ is peaked (or not) and therefore whether the total population shows 
cyclic tendencies.
$S_{\text{tot}}$ is plotted for
cases 1 and 2, respectively, in Fig. \ref{TheoryExample2}E-F. The greater
periodicity is also apparent from example $w_{\text{tot}}$ time series
(Fig. \ref{TheoryExample2}G-H).

Noise for example 2 was the sum of two processes. The first process was an 
AR(2) process. Let $\delta^{(1)}(t) = (\delta^{(1)}_1(t),\ldots,\delta^{(1)}_N(t))$ be drawn, independently for each time, $t$, from a multivariate normal distribution with mean $(0,\ldots,0)$
and covariance matrix consisting of entries $\rho_1$ in the off diagonal and $1$
in the diagonal. Let $\epsilon^{(1)}_i(t)=c_1 \epsilon^{(1)}_i(t-1) + c_2 \epsilon^{(1)}_i(t-2)+\delta^{(1)}_i(t)$. The second process was simple white noise.
Let $\epsilon^{(2)}(t) = (\epsilon^{(2)}_1(t),\ldots,\epsilon^{(2)}_N(t))$ be drawn, independently for each time, $t$, from a multivariate normal distribution with mean $(0,\ldots,0)$
and covariance matrix consisting of entries $\rho_2$ in the off diagonal and $1$
in the diagonal. The noise used was $\epsilon(t)=\epsilon^{(1)}(t)+\epsilon^{(2)}(t)$.

\subsection{Example 3} \label{SI:theory:example3} 
\noindent For example 3, we contrasted a case in 
which the synchrony of environmental noise was specific to one timescale band
with a case in which the synchrony of environmental noise was specific to
another timescale band, to show that the cycling of the regional total
population occurs on the same timescale band as the synchrony. The nature
of population dynamics and the local statistical characteristics of environmental 
noise were again kept fixed across the two cases, as was the total (across
all timescales) synchrony of environmental noise.

For example 3, the environmental noise processes 
$\epsilon_i(t)$ were constructed so that 
the power spectrum
of noise at each location was 
$S_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_i} = \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1^{(1)} \mu -c_2^{(1)} \mu^2} \right|^2+
\left| \frac{1}{1-c_1^{(2)} \mu -c_2^{(2)} \mu^2} \right|^2$ and
the cross spectrum between any two locations was 
$S_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_j}=\rho^{(1)} \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1^{(1)} \mu -c_2^{(1)} \mu^2} \right|^2+
\rho^{(2)}\left| \frac{1}{1-c_1^{(2)} \mu -c_2^{(2)} \mu^2} \right|^2$, for 
$c_1^{(1)}=2/3$, $c_2^{(1)}=-4/9$, $c_1^{(2)}=-2/3$, $c_2^{(2)}=-4/9$.
The function of frequency $\left| \frac{1}{1-c_1^{(1)} \mu -c_2^{(1)} \mu^2} \right|^2$
has a single peak at a frequency of $1/6$ cycles per sampling interval and the 
function $\left| \frac{1}{1-c_1^{(2)} \mu -c_2^{(2)} \mu^2} \right|^2$ has a single
peak at frequency $1/3$ cycles per sampling interval, so noise spectra reveal
that the noise cycles at two periodicities simultaneously. 

We considered two cases within example 3. In case 1, we used
$\rho^{(1)}=0.8$ and $\rho^{(2)}=0$, whereas in case 2 we used 
$\rho^{(1)}=0$ and $\rho^{(2)}=0.8$. Thus, of the two peridocities present
in the environmental noise, only one was synchronous in case 1, and
only the other was synchronous in case 2.
Analytically calculated 
noise spectra and estimates based on simulations are in Fig. 
\ref{TheoryExample3}A-B; likewise, for cospectra, see Fig. \ref{TheoryExample3}C-D.

Applying the theorem, 
\begin{align}
S_{\text{tot}} &= \left| \frac{1}{1-b_1 \mu} \right|^2
N\left[ \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1^{(1)}\mu-c_2^{(1)}\mu^2} \right|^2 
+ \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1^{(2)}\mu-c_2^{(2)}\mu^2} \right|^2\right] \\
&+ \left| \frac{1}{1-b_1 \mu} \right|^2
(N^2-N)\left[ \rho^{(1)} \left| \frac{1}{1-c_1^{(1)}\mu-c_2^{(1)}\mu^2} \right|^2+ \rho^{(2)}\left| \frac{1}{1-c_1^{(2)}\mu-c_2^{(2)}\mu^2} \right|^2 \right].
\end{align}
\noindent The first term here is dominated by the second in both cases. The periodicity 
in $w_{\text{tot}}$ represented by the second term depends on the values of $\rho^{(1)}$ and
$\rho^{(2)}$ in a straightforward way. The peak that manifests in
$S_{\text{tot}}$ is the peak of the synchronous one of the two components
of noise; the non-synchronous noise component has very little influence
on $S_{\text{tot}}$. $S_{\text{tot}}$ is plotted for
cases 1 and 2, respectively, in Fig. \ref{TheoryExample3}E-F. The differing
periodicities of the total population in the two cases can also be seen 
in example time series (Fig. \ref{TheoryExample3}G-H). Thus in all cases
we have examined (and quite generally, as long as $N^2-N \gg N$) 
it is the nature of synchrony that determines whether the spatial-total
population is cycling, much more so than whether noise is itself periodic.

Noise for example 3 was again the sum of two processes. 
The first process was an
AR(2) process. Let $\delta^{(1)}(t) = (\delta^{(1)}_1(t),\ldots,\delta^{(1)}_N(t))$ be drawn, independently for each time, $t$, from a multivariate normal distribution with mean $(0,\ldots,0)$
and covariance matrix consisting of entries $\rho^{(1)}$ in the off diagonal and $1$
in the diagonal. Let $\epsilon^{(1)}_i(t)=c_1^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}_i(t-1) + c_2^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}_i(t-2)+\delta^{(1)}_i(t)$. The second process was
another AR(2) process with different parameters. 
Let $\delta^{(2)}(t) = (\delta^{(2)}_1(t),\ldots,\delta^{(2)}_N(t))$ be drawn, independently for each time, $t$, from a multivariate normal distribution with mean $(0,\ldots,0)$
and covariance matrix consisting of entries $\rho^{(2)}$ in the off diagonal and $1$
in the diagonal. Let $\epsilon^{(2)}_i(t)=c_1^{(2)} \epsilon^{(2)}_i(t-1) + c_2^{(2)} \epsilon^{(2)}_i(t-2)+\delta^{(2)}_i(t)$.
The noise used was $\epsilon(t)=\epsilon^{(1)}(t)+\epsilon^{(2)}(t)$.

\subsection{Proof of the main theorem} \label{sect:mainproof}

To prove theorem \ref{prop:mainthm}, we first state and prove, and then apply,
a result that follows from basic properties of filters and stochastic processes.

\begin{thm}
Using notation defined previously, $S_{ww}=\left| \frac{\gamma}{1-\lambda} \right|^2
S_{\epsilon \epsilon}$.
\label{thm:lem}
\end{thm}

\noindent \emph{Proof.} The model (\ref{eq:mainmodel}) for $i=1,\ldots,N$ can be rewritten as 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B} w = \mathcal{P} \epsilon \label{eq:linfiltmod}
\end{equation}
\noindent for the linear filters
\begin{align}
\mathcal{B} &= I-b_1 IB - b_2 IB^2 - \cdots - b_n IB^n \\
\mathcal{P} &= p_0 I + p_1 IB + \cdots + p_m IB^m,
\end{align}
\noindent where $I$ is the $N \times N$ identity matrix. 
Here $B$ is the backshift operator,
$B^{l}\delta(t)=\delta(t-l)$, for a stochastic process $\delta(t)$.
See @Reinsel1997, @Shumway2000, and @Brillinger2001
for background on linear filters. Computing the spectral matrices of both
sides of (\ref{eq:linfiltmod}) gives
\begin{equation}
T(\mathcal{B}) S_{ww} T(\mathcal{B})^* = T(\mathcal{P}) S_{\epsilon\epsilon}
T(\mathcal{P})^*
\end{equation}
\noindent where $T(\mathcal{B})$ and $T(\mathcal{P})$ 
are the transfer function matrices of the linear filters
$\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{P}$, respectively, and the superscript $*$ denotes conjugate transpose (see, for instance,
section 1.1.3 of @Reinsel1997). But 
$T(\mathcal{B}) = (1-\lambda)I$ and $T(\mathcal{P})=\gamma I$
(section 1.1.3 of @Reinsel1997), so
\begin{align}
S_{ww} &= (1-\lambda)^{-1} I \gamma I S_{\epsilon\epsilon} \overline{\gamma} I (1-\overline{\lambda})^{-1}I \\
&= \left| \frac{\gamma}{1-\lambda} \right|^2 S_{\epsilon\epsilon},
\end{align}
\noindent as was to be demonstrated. $\blacksquare$

Now applying this result, we have
\begin{align}
S_{\text{tot}} &= \sum_{i,j} C_{w_i w_j} \\
&= \sum_{i,j} \left| \frac{\gamma}{1-\lambda} \right|^{ 2} C_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}} \\
&= \left| \frac{\gamma}{1-\lambda} \right|^{ 2} \left[ \sum_i S_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{i}} +\sum_{i \neq j} C_{\epsilon_{i}\epsilon_{j}}\right],\label{eq:splitup}
\end{align}
\noindent which proves the main theorem. The second equality above follows from
theorem \ref{thm:lem}.

# Supplementary methods \label{SI:methods}

\subsection{Deer, DVC, and hunter data}\label{SI:methods:deerDVChunter}
\noindent For `r length(unique(dat$COUNTY_NAM))` counties, we calculated deer abundance estimates 
spanning the `r dim(cty.list$Abun)[2]`-year period `r minyear`-`r maxyear` (main text Fig. 
\ref{MT-Fig2_Timeseries}). These time series were based on 
data from "deer management units," provided by 
the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WIDNR). Deer management units 
(DMUs) are regions which partition the state,
determined by the WIDNR for the purpose of deer population assessment and management
($N=$ 101-139 depending on the year).
From 1981-2013, deer abundance was estimated by the WIDNR for DMUs. For most years and DMUs, 
abundance was estimated using a sex-age-kill (SAK) model, with aerial surveys or 
accounting models used for a smaller number of years and DMUs [@widnr2001]. 
In $2014$, DMU boundaries were changed to match counties ($N=72$). Because of this, and because other spatial variables (e.g., DVCs, climate) were gathered at the county level,
we transformed the 1981-2013 abundance estimates for DMUs 
into county-level estimates. To do so, we first calculated the areas 
of intersection between DMU and county boundaries for each year (as 
DMU boundaries changed frequently), using the 'intersect' function in 
Arc GIS 10.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). We then calculated deer abundance 
for each intersection area by multiplying the amount of deer habitat in 
each intersection area by the WIDNR density estimate of deer for the DMU 
that the intersection fell within. Deer habitat was considered to comprise 
areas of permanent cover (e.g., forests) that were $>4$ ha in size, plus agriculture and grass fields within 100 m of permanent cover. DMU deer 
densities were calculated by dividing the DMU abundances originally provided to us
by the amount of deer habitat within the DMU [@widnr2001]. This procedure 
assumes approximately spatially uniform densities of deer within deer 
habitat across each DMU. The abundance for a county was the sum of 
the estimated abundances of the county's intersections with DMUs. 
We dropped one county (Menominee) due to incomplete data for most 
variables, leaving `r length(unique(dat$COUNTY_NAM))` counties for statistical analysis.

We also calculated estimated hunter abundance during the first 
two days of the annual 9-day gun hunting season, also from data from the WINDR, 
for each county for the years 1992-`r maxyear`
(main text Fig. \ref{MT-Fig2_Timeseries}); these data constituted an index of the estimated 
number of hunters during the first two days of the 9-day gun 
hunting season [@widnr2001] and hence were an index of overall hunting pressure. Gun hunters 
on average represent $`r gunhunter_percent`\%$ of the total hunters in WI
each year over the years of this study. We estimated hunter abundances for counties
using the same method as for deer abundance. We dropped 18 counties due to incomplete
survey efforts of hunters or missing data, leaving 53 counties for analysis that used
the hunter density data. 

We obtained estimates of DVCs for each county, spanning the 
years 1987-`r maxyear`, from the WI Department 
of Transportation (WIDOT; main text Fig. \ref{MT-Fig2_Timeseries}). These data reflect the number of police-investigated DVCs; they are an 
index of DVCs, as opposed to an absolute number of incidents, 
since not all DVCs are reported. In Michigan, nearly half of 
DVCs went unreported to the police or insurance companies 
over a five-year period [@Marcoux2010_dvc]. Additionally, 
DVC information was collected with reporting effort that 
may have varied for different counties 
(Daniel Storm, WIDNR, Personal Communication), and the 
threshold of damage for the police to respond to and report on 
an incident increased statewide in 1996 from US\$500 to US\$1000. 
However, features of the data such as these could only have obscured 
and could not have artefactually generated the strongly 
significant spatial wavelet coherence relationships we report between 
DVCs and deer abundance. Shortcomings of the DVC data added 
noise and likely obscured the relationship 
with deer abundance, so that if better DVC data were available 
this relationship would likely have been even stronger than reported. 
We also obtained traffic volume estimates (millions of miles 
driven) for each county spanning the years 1988-`r maxyear` from the 
WIDOT, to control for traffic in our analysis of DVCs.

\subsection{Climate data notes}\label{SI:methods:climatedata}
\noindent We obtained daily weather data (snow depth, 
precipitation, and minimum and maximum air temperature - here called Tmin and Tmax) from all available weather stations in each county from the 
National Climatic Data Center ([`https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/`](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)). We 
averaged daily values across the winter ($\text{Dec}_{t-1}$ 
to $\text{Mar}_t$) and across stations within a county to produce 
annual time series of winter weather by county which were used in 
all subsequent analyses (main text Fig. \ref{MT-Fig2_Timeseries}). The number of weather stations per county and data collected at each station 
varied, resulting in different spatial extents of time series available for for each variable 
in order to retain the full temporal extent: Tmin, $N=$ `r dim(winter.clim$Tmin[!is.na(rowMeans(winter.clim$Tmin)),])[1]`
counties; Tmax, $N=$ `r dim(winter.clim$Tmax[!is.na(rowMeans(winter.clim$Tmax)),])[1]`; precipitation, $N=$ `r dim(winter.clim$Prcp[!is.na(rowMeans(winter.clim$Prcp)),])[1]`; snow depth, $N=$ `r dim(winter.clim$Snwd[!is.na(rowMeans(winter.clim$Snwd)),])[1]`. 
We also calculated a Winter Severity Index (WSI, $N=$ `r dim(winter.clim$WSI[!is.na(rowMeans(winter.clim$WSI)),])[1]`), 
a metric known to impact deer populations [@widnr2001]. WSI is the sum of the total number of days for which snow depth was greater 
than 18 inches or Tmin was less than $0^\circ$F. 

We obtained monthly estimates of three global climate indices: 
the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the multivariate 
El Ni$\~{n}$o Southern Oscillation Index (MEI), and the Pacific 
Decadal Oscillation (PDO). All of these have been shown to 
influence large ungulate population dynamics in the north central 
USA [@Post1998_popgrowth;@Post2004_greenland]. 
We averaged monthly values across the 
approximate growing season (Apr-Nov), and separately across the winter 
($\text{Dec}_{t-1}$ to $\text{Mar}_t$) for each index 
(main text Fig. \ref{MT-Fig2_Timeseries}). We used a total of 11 weather and 
climate variables in subsequent analyses: winter Tmin, Tmax, 
snow depth, and precipitation; winter NAO ($\text{NAO}_{\text{w}}$), MEI ($\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$), and PDO ($\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$); 
growing-season NAO ($\text{NAO}_{\text{s}}$), MEI ($\text{MEI}_{\text{s}}$) and PDO ($\text{PDO}_{\text{s}}$); and the WSI. 

\subsection{Data pre-processing} \label{SI:methods:preprocessing} 
\noindent We performed all analyses described below and in the main text 
at three spatial scales: counties (N = 44-`r dim(cty.list$Abun)[1]` depending on 
the variables involved; mean county 
area $\pm$ SD = `r round(mean(gps$Area_km2),0)` $\pm$ `r round(sd(gps$Area_km2),0)` $\text{km}^2$), 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) districts ($N = 9$; mean 
district area $\pm$ SD = `r round(mean(usda.centroid$Area_km2),0)` $\pm$ `r round(sd(usda.centroid$Area_km2),0)` $\text{km}^2$), 
and statewide (Fig. \ref{FigS1_map}). Analyses at three spatial scales 
were performed because the SAK model used by the WIDNR to estimate deer 
abundance for each management unit has been criticized as less accurate 
at smaller spatial scales [@Millspaugh2009]. This criticism of the 
SAK model may have been overstated, as more recent analyses 
within the WIDNR suggest that uncertainty in SAK estimates is substantially less 
than the $121\%$ error rates indicataed by @Millspaugh2009. Analyses of WI deer abundance 
data for a subset 
of years produced $95\%$ credible intervals around population estimates that were $\pm20-40\%$. 
In addition, the criticism of the SAK [@Millspaugh2009] was based 
on a model that did not match perfectly with practices of the WIDNR. 
Nevertheless, 
to ensure our results were not biased, we analyzed 
synchrony on multiple spatial scales including two larger scales 
(districts and statewide) for which SAK data have not been criticized. 
USDA district data were produced as the sum or 
average of county-level variables, as districts were always conglomerates 
of counties (Fig. \ref{FigS1_map}). 
Statewide analysis used state total or average time series for each 
variable. In general, results remained unchanged in their main substance using data 
aggregated to larger spatial scales (Table \ref{TabS2_SummaryDistrict}, 
Fig. \ref{FigS7_WMFAndPredictionsDistricts}), suggesting results for counties were not 
meaningfully influenced by possible inaccuracies in SAK abundance estimation 
procedures at the county level. We also emphasize that inaccuracies 
in the estimation of deer abundances may have obscured the patterns of
timescale-specific synchrony and the spatial wavelet coherence results we 
report, but could not reasonably have artefactually created them.

We performed an optimal Box-Cox transformation on each time series to help ensure Gaussian marginal 
distributions [@Sheppard2016_aphids], which are necessary for the Fourier-surrogate-based spatial 
wavelet coherence testing procedures described below. This process also 
included linear detrending (and subtracting the mean) to remove any long-term trends that might 
otherwise obscure patterns of synchrony [@Buonaccorsi2001]. Time series
variances were also standardized to 1. These steps were done via the `cleandat` function in the 
`wsyn` package for the R programming language [@wsyn].

\subsection{The wavelet mean field and wavelet phasor mean field}\label{SI:methods:meanfields} 
\noindent We assessed the strength of synchrony 
and its dependence on time and timescale for 
all spatiotemporal variables using two 
statistical tools: the wavelet mean field and 
the wavelet phasor mean field [@Sheppard2013;@Sheppard2016_aphids]. 
Both techniques take as 
input time series measured at the same times 
in several locations, and return as output 
complex-number-valued functions of time 
and timescale. When the magnitudes of these complex functions are plotted against time 
and timescale, the plots characterize the degree 
of synchrony among the input time series and how 
it may have changed over time or differed by 
timescale (Figs \ref{MT-Fig1_example}, \ref{PedagogFigWMF}). 
The wavelet phasor mean field magnitude 
quantifies the degree to which phases of 
oscillation in the input time series were the 
same across locations, as a function of time 
and timescale. The wavelet mean field 
magnitude incorporates information not only 
on phase synchronization but also on the 
tendency of oscillatory components on any 
given timescale to have magnitudes which are 
correlated through time across the sampling 
locations (i.e., oscillations on a given timescale
tend to all be strong, or, respectively, weak, at the same times). 
Both the wavelet phasor and wavelet mean fields are based 
on complex Morlet 
wavelet transforms of each input time series. 
All plots based on wavelet transforms are "scalloped", i.e., values corresponding 
to longer timescales and times closer to the start or end of available data are not plotted. 
This is because the wavelet transform is based on convolutions of wavelet functions with 
the timeseries being transformed. Convolution values for which a substantial portion of the wavelet 
function overhangs the edge of the data are unreliable. "Scalloping" wavelet plots is 
standard practice.
Wavelet mean fields were computed using the
function `wmf` and wavelet phasor mean fields were computed 
using the function `wpmf` in the `wsyn` package [@wsyn].

\subsection{The wavelet mean field and wavelet phasor mean field, technical background}\label{SI:methods:meanfieldstech} 
\noindent Technical background on the wavelet mean field was taken from 
@Sheppard2016_aphids, and is reproduced here for reader convenience. Letting 
$x_i(t)$ denote a population index for habitat patch $i$ ($i=1,\ldots,N$) at time $t$
($t=1,\ldots,T$), and denoting by $W_{i,\sigma}(t)$ the wavelet transform of this
time series evaluated at timescale $\sigma$ and time $t$, the wavelet mean field is 
\begin{equation}
r^{\text{wmf}}_{\sigma}(t)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N w_{i,\sigma}(t),
\end{equation}
\noindent where
\begin{equation}
w_{i,\sigma}(t)=\frac{W_{i,\sigma}(t)}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{NT}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^T W_{i,\sigma}(t) \overline{W_{i,\sigma}(t)}}}.\label{eq:pownormwt}
\end{equation}
\noindent The overbar denotes complex conjugation. The $w_{i,\sigma}(t)$ are power-normalized wavelet 
transforms, i.e., the denominator of the equation above is the square root of the 
average wavelet power of the time series over habitat patches. That denominator is
only a positive scalar, so the $w_{i,\sigma}(t)$ comprise basically the same information
as the $W_{i,\sigma}(t)$. For instance, the phases of the $w_{i,\sigma}(t)$
are identical to the phases of the $W_{i,\sigma}(t)$, and represent the phase of oscillation
in $x_i(t)$ at time $t$ and timescale $\sigma$. 

The magnitude of the 
wavelet mean field is a sensible measure of the time and timescale dependence 
of synchrony because when the fluctuations at timescale $\sigma$ and time $t$ in
the time series $x_i(t)$ have similar phase in all or most locations and are
therefore synchronized, the corresponding phases of the transforms $w_{i,\sigma}(t)$
will also be similar, so the sum $\sum_{i=1}^N w_{i,\sigma}(t)$ will be a large-magnitude 
complex number; whereas unrelated phases will typically lead to a small-magnitude sum. 
@Sheppard2016_aphids also prove that the mean squared magnitude of $r^{\text{wmf}}_{\sigma}(t)$,
i.e., $\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T |r^{\text{wmf}}_{\sigma}(t)|^2$, is between $0$ and $1$ and is equal to
$1$ if and only if the time series $x_i(t)$ are identical. They also prove that this 
quantity is the wavelet power of the average time series, divided by the average of the
powers of all the time series, so that if time series are unsynchronized, power in the 
average time series will tend to be reduced (unsynchronized fluctuations tend to cancel
when summed). This reasoning provides another intuitively understandable justification for the 
wavelet mean field magnitude as a measure of synchrony. Thus, $\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T |r^{\text{wmf}}_{\sigma}(t)|^2$
is a timescale-specific measure of synchrony. Methods that relate to the wavelet mean 
field have been used previously to study synchrony in ecology [@Keitt2006; @Viboud2006; @Keitt2008].

We also provide technical background on the wavelet phasor mean field, taken from
@Sheppard_wavmodel and reproduced here for reader convenience. 
Again denoting the data time series by $x_i(t)$ and their wavelet transforms by
$W_{i,\sigma}(t)$, the wavelet phasor mean field is 
\begin{equation}
r^{\text{wpmf}}_\sigma(t)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{W_{i,\sigma}(t)}{|W_{i,\sigma}(t)|}.
\end{equation}
\noindent The quantities $\frac{W_{i,\sigma}(t)}{|W_{i,\sigma}(t)|}$ are unit-magnitude complex 
numbers, also known as phasors. The magnitude of $r^{\text{wpmf}}_\sigma(t)$ is between
$0$ and $1$, with larger values corresponding to more phase synchrony. 

Statistical significance of the wavelet phasor mean 
field, compared to a null hypothesis of no phase 
synchrony, can be assessed for each combination of 
time and timescale. For any given time and 
timescale, significance testing compares the degree 
of phase consistency between sampling locations for 
the empirical time series (as measured by $|r_\sigma^{\text{wpmf}}(t)|$) to a null hypothesis of random 
phases (as measured by $\left| \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \exp(2\pi u_i \iota)  \right|$, where $\iota$ (the Greek letter iota) 
is the imaginary unit 
and the $u_i$ are independent uniformly distributed random variables on the unit interval). 
If empirical phase consistency was greater than 
that of $99.9\%$ of sets of random phases 
($P < 0.001$, one-tailed test, see contours on, e.g., main text 
Figs \ref{MT-Fig3_DeerSync}B and \ref{MT-Fig4_DvcSync}B), synchrony was 
deemed significant and important 
[@Sheppard_wavmodel]. Wavelet mean field and 
wavelet phasor mean field magnitude plots for 
winter weather variables are in 
Fig. \ref{FigS8_WMFsAndWPMFsAncillary}.

\subsection{Spatial wavelet coherence and wavelet coherence}\label{SI:methods:coherence} 
\noindent For both county- and district-level data, we 
assessed pairwise relationships between 
spatiotemporal variables using the spatial wavelet coherence 
technique [@Sheppard2013;@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard2017_surrogates]. Spatial wavelet coherence tests whether two 
spatiotemporal variables exhibit consistent phase 
differences and correlated magnitudes of 
oscillation through time and across space, as a 
function of timescale. Significance is determined 
by comparing spatial wavelet coherence of data with 
spatial wavelet coherences of appropriately randomized, 
surrogate data sets ($N=$ `r nsurrogs` surrogates 
were used for all tests) 
that retain the same 
temporal and spatial autocorrelation properties as 
the original time series but are otherwise 
unrelated to each other [@Theiler1992;@Schreiber2000]. Standard Fourier 
surrogates were used [@Schreiber2000;@Sheppard2013;@Sheppard2016_aphids], see below for further details. 
We calculated how often observed spatial wavelet coherence 
between pairs of variables was ranked higher than 
coherences of surrogate data sets, aggregating 
across the timescale band of interest using an 
average-rank-based method described in detail 
elsewhere [@Sheppard2016_aphids] and below. A $p$-value of $0.05$ 
means that the empirical spatial wavelet coherence was higher, in an average 
sense across the timescale band of interest, than the same 
quantity calculated for `r 0.95*nsurrogs` of `r nsurrogs` 
surrogate data sets representing the null hypothesis of no relationship between variables. Ranks of actual spatial wavelet
coherences in surrogate spatial wavelet coherences were 
also plotted as a function of timescale 
(Fig. \ref{FigS5_RanksInSurrogs}). Spatial wavelet coherences were computed 
and results were processed using the `coh`, `bandtest`, `plotrank`, 
`plotphase` and related functions in the `wsyn` package. The fast 
algorithm of  @Sheppard2017_surrogates for assessing the statistical 
significance of spatial wavelet coherence was used.

Correlation-based approaches have been standard practice in synchrony studies [@Buonaccorsi2001], but 
these methods assume in-phase relationships. Correlation-based approaches also conflate timescales, 
and recent results show this can hinder detection of synchronous phenomena by obscuring important 
synchrony on some timescales with asynchronous or noisy dynamics on other timescales 
[@Sheppard2016_aphids]. Moreover, synchrony must be specific to certain timescales to produce cyclic 
dynamics of total populations on those timescales (main text Fig. \ref{MT-Fig1_example}). 
In contrast, spatial wavelet coherence 
allows for any kind of phase relationship and 
provides as part of its output the average phase difference that occurred between two variables. It is also  timescale-specific. Therefore, when two variables had significant 
spatial wavelet coherence over a timescale band, we 
calculated the mean phase difference between the 
variables over the band, $\bar{\theta}$, in units of $\pi$ 
radians, to determine if oscillations had 
approximately in-phase ($|\bar{\theta}|=0$ to 
$0.25$), quarter-cycle ($|\bar{\theta}|=0.25$ to 
$0.75$), or anti-phase ($|\bar{\theta}|=0.75$ to 
$1$) relationships. We used "scalloped" 
wavelet transforms for 
calculating phase differences. Phase difference was not meaningful when spatial
wavelet coherence was not significant and so was not reported.

We used spatial wavelet coherence to test 
five weather variables (average winter Tmin, 
Tmax, snow depth, precipitation, and WSI), six 
climate variables (winter and growing season PDO, 
MEI and NAO) and hunter abundance as potential 
drivers of synchrony in deer abundance over the 
$3-7$-year timescale band. We also used spatial wavelet
coherence to test for a relationship of deer 
abundance with DVCs, and deer abundance with DVCs 
adjusted for traffic volume. When the temporal and 
spatial extents of available data for two spatiotemporal variables 
were not identical, we retained only the 
locations and time range over which data were 
available for both variables when testing for 
spatial wavelet coherence. When testing for spatial 
wavelet coherence between a spatiotemporal variable and a 
climate index (PDO, MEI or NAO, each of which 
comprised only a single time series), we considered 
that the same index time series pertained to all 
locations for which the spatiotemporal variable was 
measured. 

As with correlations, causal relationships between variables are not directly 
revealed by the spatial wavelet coherence. But biological arguments, combined 
with significant coherence and phase information, 
can strongly support one causal hypothesis over 
others [@Sheppard2016_aphids]. Climate and weather variables could not reasonably be influenced 
by deer abundance. Therefore, a highly significant 
spatial wavelet coherence between a climate or weather variable and 
deer abundance on a timescale band of interest 
provides strong evidence that either the weather 
variable helped cause deer fluctuations and 
synchrony for those timescales, possibly 
indirectly, or some other weather variable, 
highly spatially 
coherent with the first climate or weather variable, caused the 
fluctuations and synchrony. The highly significant 
coherence between deer abundances and DVCs we 
present in the main text is likewise probably 
indicative of greater deer abundances resulting in 
more DVCs. DVCs are too uncommon to meaningfully 
influence deer abundance (main text Fig. \ref{MT-Fig2_Timeseries}), 
and the in-phase relationship that our analyses revealed  between 
deer abundances and DVCs on $3-7$-year timescales 
is more consistent with deer 
dynamics driving DVC dynamics than the reverse. The reverse causation, if it occcurred,
would have produced an anti-phase relationship between these variables, with many DVCs
in a year corresponding to reduced deer abundance that year; such a 
relationship was not observed. Thus whereas causal relationships can never be proven absolutely in 
an observational study such as ours, the combination of significant coherences, simple biological reasoning,
and phase relationships provides strong evidence for the statements made in the main text
that weather/climatic synchrony partly causes deer synchrony and deer synchrony partly causes DVC synchrony
on the $3-7$-year timescale band.

\subsection{Spatial wavelet coherence and wavelet coherence, technical background}\label{SI:methods:coherencetech} 
\noindent Technical background on the spatial wavelet coherence was taken from
@Sheppard2016_aphids and @Sheppard_wavmodel, but is also available elsewhere, e.g, @Prichard1994. It is reproduced 
here for reader convenience. If $x_i^{(0)}(t)$ and $x_i^{(1)}(t)$ are two quantities measured
at locations $i=1,\ldots,N$ and times $t=1,\ldots,T$, then the spatial wavelet coherence
is the magnitude of
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{\sigma}^{(01)}=\frac{1}{NT}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t=1}^T w^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t) \overline{w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)},\label{eq:spatwavcoh}
\end{equation}
\noindent where the $w^{(k)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$ are the power-normalized wavelet transforms of the
$x_i^{(k)}(t)$, for $k=0,1$ (see (\ref{eq:pownormwt}) above). But the complex number 
$w^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t) \overline{w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)}$ has phase equal to the phase difference 
between $w^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$ and $w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$, so the sum over $i$ and $t$ in 
(\ref{eq:spatwavcoh}) will be large if this phase difference is consistent over space and time,
and will tend to be small otherwise. The wavelet components $w^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$ and $w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$
can also have varying magnitudes, and the spatial wavelet coherence will be larger if 
there are correlations in how these amplitudes fluctuate. The spatial wavelet coherence 
is between $0$ and $1$ [@Sheppard2016_aphids]. When $N=1$, the spatial
wavelet coherence is the wavelet coherence, a standard method [@Torrence1998; @addison2002].
The wavelet coherence and spatial wavelet coherence also relate to the phase coherence 
of a single pair of transforms, a measure 
which has been used previously in ecology [@Grenfell2001; @Viboud2006]. The phase of 
$\Pi_\sigma^{(01)}$, which we report in some of our tables, is the average phase difference between 
$x_i^{(0)}(t)$ and $x_i^{(1)}(t)$, as a function of timescale. Note that the spatial 
wavelet coherence registers the strength of relationship between 
$x_i^{(0)}(t)$ and $x_i^{(1)}(t)$, as a function of timescale, regardless of whether those time
series are in phase, or phase shifted, at that timescale.

The strength of the spatial coherence of $x_i^{(0)}(t)$ and $x_i^{(1)}(t)$ that one would expect
under the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between these variables depends on the 
levels of spatial and temporal autocorrelation the variables display. For example, if each of the two
variables is a very regular oscillator of the same phase in all locations, then the phase 
difference between the variables is forced to be consistent across time and space even if the 
variables are not related. On the other hand, irregular and/or spatially unsynchronized oscillators 
will not tend to maintain a consistent phase difference across time and space unless there is some
relationship between these variables that makes them do so. We tested for significance of 
spatial wavelet coherence through a randomization method of @Prichard1994, which is a straightforward extension
of the well known Fourier surrogate method of @Theiler1992, and which takes into account
the autocorrelation properties of the data by using surrogate (i.e., randomized)
datasets for which phase relationships between the variables are eliminated while retaining 
the same autocorrelation properties as the original data. Calculating the spatial wavelet 
coherence of a large number of surrogate datasets and comparing the distribution of values
to the spatial wavelet coherence of the original data provides our significance tests. The Fourier surrogate procedure
functions, in principle, by calculating the Fourier transform of each time series, randomizing the 
phases, and reverse transforming [@Theiler1992; @Prichard1994]. In forming a 
surrogate dataset for $x_i^{(k)}(t)$, the same phase
randomizations are used for all $i$, to ensure that its spatial as well as temporal autocorrelation
properties are maintained; between-location cross spectra are preserved, and hence so is
the structure of spatial autocorrelation for each variable [@Prichard1994]. In practice, we used the 
algorithm of @Sheppard2017_surrogates, which is conceptually the same as what we have just described, but 
for technical reasons is much computationally faster and 
also has slightly improved statistical power under some circumstances. 

The rank of the spatial wavelet 
coherence of data in the set of surrogate spatial wavelet coherence values, for a given timescale, provides a
test of significance of coherence for that timescale (Fig. \ref{FigS5_RanksInSurrogs}).
However, to reduce multiple-testing problems and because wavelet statistics based on finite-length
data have finite capacity to resolve timescales, we instead relied principally on whether spatial wavelet
coherence was significant in an average sense across a timescale band of interest, e.g., $3-7$ years
[@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Sheppard_wavmodel].
To produce aggregate significance values for spatial wavelet coherence for a timescale band, the rank of coherence
relative to surrogates (rank 1 was highest) was averaged across the band. The same procedure was then 
applied to each surrogate individually, i.e., for each timescale, a surrogate spatial wavelet
coherence was ranked againt the other surrogate coherences, and the band-average rank was computed
for the single surrogate, the process then being repeated for each surrogate. Thus the mean rank
across the band was computed for the data and for each surrogate, and the data mean rank was appropriately compared to the 
distribution of surrogate mean ranks to form the band-aggregate test of significance.

\subsection{Wavelet Moran theorem, fractions of synchrony explained, and the "predicted synchrony" plot}\label{SI:methods:Morantheorem} 
\noindent We calculated 
fractions of deer abundance 
synchrony explained by snow depth and hunter abundance, as well as the fraction of DVC 
synchrony explained by deer abundance, following 
the wavelet Moran theorem of @Sheppard2016_aphids. 
As part of this procedure, we also calculated the 
average "cross terms" of @Sheppard2016_aphids over 
the timescale band of interest (see supplementary 
files of @Sheppard2016_aphids, equation 22), again following the 
procedures described in that reference. The precise 
mathematical meaning of cross terms is explained by @Sheppard2016_aphids, and also below; 
for operational purposes, they 
provide a test of whether modelling assumptions of @Sheppard2016_aphids are sufficiently met to use the 
wavelet Moran theorem to estimate fractions of 
synchrony explained. Cross terms less than $10\%$ 
of estimated fractions of synchrony explained were 
considered necessary to make statements about fractions of synchrony explained. 
The wavelet Moran theorem also provides a "predicted synchrony" plot, which has the same format
as the wavelet mean field magnitude plot, and can be compared to it, but shows what the pattern
of synchrony in a variable, e.g., DVCs, would look like if the only synchronizing
influences on it were those of another variable, e.g., deer abundance [@Sheppard_wavmodel]. 
If the predicted synchrony plot is similar to the actual wavelet mean field magnitude plot 
for DVCs then it provides visual support for the hypothesis that deer synchrony causes DVC synchrony.
The function `wlm` and related functions from `wsyn` implement these tools.

\subsection{Wavelet Moran theorem, fractions of synchrony explained, and the "predicted synchrony" plot, technical background}\label{SI:methods:Morantheoremtech}
\noindent Technical background on the wavelet Moran theorem and related ideas was taken from
@Sheppard2016_aphids and @Sheppard_wavmodel, and is reproduced here for reader convenience.
If $x_i^{(0)}(t)$ and $x_i^{(1)}(t)$ are again two quantities measured
at locations $i=1,\ldots,N$ and times $t=1,\ldots,T$, and again denoting by $w^{(k)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$ 
the power-normalized wavelet transforms of the
$x_i^{(k)}(t)$, for $k=0,1$ (see (\ref{eq:pownormwt}) above), then for 
a given $\sigma$ and a given $k$, the components $w^{(k)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$ for $i=1,\ldots,N$
can be viewed as points in the complex space $\mathbb{C}^{D}$, where $D$ is the product of $N$ and
the number of time steps,
$t$, for which $w^{(k)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$ is defined.
We use the inner product $w^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t) \cdot w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t) =
\frac{1}{NT} \sum_i \sum_t w_{i,\sigma}^{(0)}(t) \conj[w_{i,\sigma}^{(1)}(t)]$
on this space, and denote the associated norm by $\| \cdot \|$. The variable 
$x_i^{(0)}(t)$ is understood to be the population quantity the synchrony of which we want to
understand, and the variable $x_i^{(1)}(t)$ is taken to be an environmental or other factor which
may help cause synchrony in $x_i^{(0)}(t)$, through a Moran effect.

The wavelet Moran theorem, as stated by @Sheppard2016_aphids, is as follows.

\begin{thm}\label{th:MoranTheorem}
\emph{The wavelet Moran theorem.}
We can write $w^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t)=\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma} w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)+d_{i,\sigma}(t)$, where this equation defines
$d_{i,\sigma}(t)$.
Then $w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t) \cdot d_{i,\sigma}(t)=0$, and for each $\sigma$,
$\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}$ is the complex value that minimizes $\| d_{i,\sigma}(t) \|$. The $d_{i,\sigma}(t)$ can be interpreted as residuals.
The time average of the squared magnitude of the wavelet mean field of the $x_i^{(0)}(t)$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}|r^{(\text{\emph{wmf}},0)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2  & = &
    |\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|^2\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} |r^{(\text{\emph{wmf}},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2 \label{eq:Moranmain1}\\
  & + & {\frac{1}{TN^2}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{ j\not=i}
    2\Rp(\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma} w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)\conj[d_{j,\sigma}(t)])} \label{eq:T2} \\
  & + &  \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{i,\sigma}(t) \right|^2. \label{eq:Moranmain3}
\end{eqnarray}
If populations $x_i^{(0)}(t)$ do not interact directly in any substantial way with populations $x_j^{(0)}(t)$ for $j\neq i$ at neighboring sites, nor are they
directly affected by environments $x_j^{(1)}(t)$ in neighboring sites, interpreted
as the term in \emph{(\ref{eq:T2})} being negligible (see justification below and in 
Shepparrd \emph{et al.} 2016),
then
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}|r^{(\text{\emph{wmf}},0)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2  \approx
|\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|^2\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} |r^{(\text{\emph{wmf}},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2
+ \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{i,\sigma}(t) \right|^2.
\label{eq:Moran}
\end{equation}
In other words, synchrony of $x_i^{(0)}(t)$ can be divided into a component due to
$x_i^{(1)}(t)$ and residual synchrony. It follows that
$\<|r^{(\text{\emph{wmf}},0)}_{\sigma}(t)|\>  \geq|\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|\<|r^{(\text{\emph{wmf}},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|\>$,
where the angle brackets denote the square root of the time-averaged squared value.
If, in addition, the only synchronizing
influence on $x_i^{(0)}(t)$ is $x_i^{(1)}(t)$, interpreted as the second term on
the right side of \emph{(\ref{eq:Moran})} being negligible, then
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}|r^{(\text{\emph{wmf}},0)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2   \approx
    |\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|^2\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} |r^{(\text{\emph{wmf}},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2 \label{eq:mainMoran}
\end{equation}
and
$\<|r^{(\text{\emph{wmf}},0)}_{\sigma}(t)|\>  \approx |\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|\<|r^{(\text{\emph{wmf}},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|\>$.
Thus $|\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|\<|r^{(\text{\emph{wmf}},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|\>$ gives the amount of synchrony
in $x_i^{(0)}(t)$ explained solely by the synchronizing influence of $x_i^{(1)}(t)$.
\end{thm}
\noindent The proof is provided by @Sheppard2016_aphids. 

The assumptions that populations $x_i^{(0)}(t)$ do not interact 
directly with populations $x_j^{(0)}(t)$ for $j \neq i$ at neighboring 
sites, nor are they
directly affected by environments $x_j^{(1)}(t)$ in neighboring sites, were interpreted to mean
(\ref{eq:T2}) is negligible. Again paraphrasing from @Sheppard2016_aphids,
this is reasonable because, for populations meeting those assumptions, the magnitude of
$\frac{1}{TN^2} \sum_t \sum_i \sum_{j\not=i} w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t) \conj[d_{j,\sigma}(t)]$
will be negligible, as this expression quantifies relationships between the fluctuations of variable
$1$, measured with $w_{i,\sigma}^{(1)}(t)$, and residuals at other sites, $d_{j,\sigma}(t)$. 
Large cross terms correspond to a general association between $w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$
at one location, $i$, and residuals, $d_{j,\sigma}(t)$, at another location, $j$. 
Such associations may occur as a result of the population at the first location 
dispersing to the second location and being included in the count there. Considering a 
coarser spatial scale limits the potential for dispersal to have such an influence on 
our statistics, so one expects that if cross terms are large at the county spatial 
scale, the problem may be mitigated at the district scale, as happened for many
of our analyses (see section "USDA district results" in SI Appendix). 

<!--Information on calculating, using the wavelet Moran theorem, the 
fraction of synchrony explained. Also the predicted synchrony plots.-->
Using the wavelet Moran theorem, and assuming cross terms are negligible, 
the pattern of synchrony in $x_i^{(0)}(t)$ that would be predicted if the only
synchronizing influence on it were $x_i^{(1)}(t)$ is 
$|\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}||r^{(\text{wmf},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|$. This is similar to (\ref{eq:Moranmain1}),
but without the time averages and taking a square root. The predicted synchrony expression follows
from the proof of the wavelet Moran theorem [@Sheppard2016_aphids; @Sheppard_wavmodel].
The fraction of the synchrony in $x_i^{(0)}(t)$ explained by synchrony in $x_i^{(1)}(t)$,
as a function of timescale, is 
\begin{equation}
q(\sigma)=\frac{|\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|^2\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} |r^{(\text{wmf},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2}{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}|r^{(\text{wmf},0)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2}.\label{eq:syncexpl}
\end{equation}
\noindent This was averaged over a timescale band of interest.  

\subsection{ Fraction of deer synchrony explained by $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$, technical methods}\label{SI:methods:fractionMEI} 
\noindent Fractions of deer abundance synchrony explained by snow depth and fractions of DVC synchrony
explain by deer, and related results, were presented in the main text, but we did not there present results
on fractions of deer abundance synchrony explained by $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$, even though deer abundance and $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$
were significantly coherent, supporting the 
hypothesis that a Moran effect related to MEI was partly responsible for deer
synchrony. As mentioned briefly in the main text, this choice was because the wavelet Moran theorem and 
related techniques are more complex and less effective when 
data are not spatially resolved. MEI is a single index, so was not spatially resolved. What follows is a 
technical description of 1) why applying the wavelet Moran theorem to $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ and deer abundance 
can produce overfitted models and inflated estimates of fractions of deer synchrony explained
by $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$; and 2) steps we took to try to quantify the degree of inflation. Results of the
procedures described here are in SI section \ref{SI:results}.

It is possible to apply the formalism of the wavelet Moran theorem to deer abundance data and 
$\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$, even though doing so results in complications, as we will explain. We can thus write 
$w^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t)=\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma} w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)+d_{i,\sigma}(t)$, as in the 
statement of the wavelet Moran theorem,
where the $w^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$ are the power-normalized wavelet transforms of the deer abundance
time series and the $w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$ are the power-normalized wavelet transforms of $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ and therefore are the same for all locations, $i$. The theorem then provides a decomposition 
of synchrony, $\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}|r^{(\text{wmf},0)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2  = |\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|^2\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} |r^{(\text{wmf},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2 + \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{i,\sigma}(t) \right|^2$.
The cross terms of (\ref{eq:T2}) are identically zero in the present case
because the $w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$ are the same for all $i$ [@Sheppard2016_aphids]. For the same reason, 
it is straightforward to show that 
$\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} |r^{(\text{wmf},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2=1$. So therefore
$\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}|r^{(\text{wmf},0)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2  = |\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|^2 + \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left| \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{i,\sigma}(t) \right|^2$, and the synchrony in deer abundance 
explained by $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ is just $|\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|^2$. This is the quantity we statistically tested using surrogates to 
determine if it is larger than expected under the null hypothesis, and it was for $3-7$-year timescales
(Table \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary}), 
supporting the claim that $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ explains a significant portion of the synchrony in deer abundance.

However, distributions of surrogate spatial wavelet coherence values, albeit generally smaller than the 
observed spatial wavelet coherence values, $|\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|$, on $3-7$-year timescales, were 
not centered on zero.   Spurious 
associations between time series produce non-zero coherence, and this bias apparent in the surrogate 
distribution becomes stronger as fewer independent samples of the phase difference between the variables 
are available.   For long-timescale wavelet components of the transform of an autocorrelated variable, the 
rate of phase growth changes slowly in time and a spurious initial phase association between variables is likely to persist 
throughout the data, giving spuriously high coherence.   Where separately measured data are available for each site, 
this spurious association would be expected to have a different phase at each site and be averaged out in the 
spatial coherence. But MEI data were not spatial. Whereas we can conclude, due to the significance testing results, 
that there is probably a real association between $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ and deer fluctuations, bias may still manifest in the 
form of a spurious association between $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ and additional local variability in deer abundance that is actually 
independent of MEI, exagerating the apparent coherence between deer and $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$.  So the lack of spatial resolution in the 
$\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ index means, in summary, that the estimated coherence, $|\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|$ between deer abundance and $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$
(and therefore the deer synchrony, $|\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|^2$, explained by MEI), was significant, but may be inflated: we know MEI-related Moran effects probably helped cause
deer abundance synchrony, but we do not know to what extent. Naive application of the wavelet
Moran theorem suggests that $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ explains $`r round(abunwmeiSyncExp37,0)`\%$ of deer abundance synchrony 
on $3-7$-year timescales. The goal now is to estimate to what extent these values are inflated.

<!--Description of procedure for estimating inflation-->
To assess the levels of inflation in $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$-deer coherence estimates and therefore in estimates of amount of 
deer synchrony explained by
$\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$, we performed simulation exercises with artificial data chosen to mimic properties of the real time-series, but 
with the advantage that we could simulate extremely long time series and thus obtain unbiased estimates of 
coherence and synchrony explained, for comparison with the estimates based on realistic-length data.
We first fitted an AR(2) model to the $36$-year $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ time series we used for our other analyses, obtaining
the maximum-likelihood result $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}(t+1)=a\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}(t)+b\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}(t-1)+\delta(t)$
where $a=-0.1702$, $b=-0.2877$, and the standard deviation of $\delta$ was $0.9745$. We then used the resulting 
fitted model to generate artificial MEI time series of any desired length, always after discarding a burn-in of $>100$
time steps to eliminate possible transient dynamics. We then used the resulting simulated $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ stand-in time series
to drive a model of deer abundance, $x_i(t)$, in county $i$ ($i=1,\ldots,N$ for $N=71$ counties), as follows: 
$x_i(t)=\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}(t)+\epsilon_i(t)$, where the $\epsilon(t)=(\epsilon_1(t),\ldots,\epsilon_{N}(t))$
were independent draws from a multi-variate normal random variable with mean $(0,\ldots,0)$ and 
covariance matrix having variance terms $V$ along the diagonal and all off-diagonal (covariance)
terms equal to $Vc$, so that the correlation of noises in different places was $c$. 
We later also consider an AR(1)-type model (see below). For given values of the parameters $\sqrt{V}$ and $c$, we performed wavelet transforms and 
obtained a wavelet model $w^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t)=\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma} w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)+d_{i,\sigma}(t)$
expressing the transforms, $w^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$, of the simulated deer time series in terms of the 
transforms, $w^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$, of the simulated MEI, which were the same for all $i$. For each simulated set of deer
time series we used an independent simulated MEI time series. After some preliminary investigation of the parameter 
space, we considered $\sqrt{V}$ varying from $1.6\exp(-0.4)$ to $1.6\exp(0.4)$ in multiplicative increments
of $\exp(0.08)$, and we considered $c$ varying from $0.175$ to $0.625$ in additive increments of $0.025$.
For each of these combinations of $\sqrt{V}$ and $c$ we computed three quantities, described in the next 
paragraph, and compared these quantities to values of the same statistics computed for the actual $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ and deer abundance time series in order to find the values of $\sqrt{V}$ and $c$ for which agreement was good.

The three quantities were as follows. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first quantity ($A$) was the spatial synchrony, measured using a 
time- and band-averaged squared mean field magnitude, of the simulated deer data. In other words: 
1) $|r_\sigma^{(\text{wmf},0)}(t)|^2$ was computed for the simulated deer time series; 2) for each 
$\sigma$, the quantity was averaged over all times for which it was defined; and 3) those results
were averaged over $3-7$-year timescales. 
\item The second quantity ($B$) was the fraction of wavelet power for deer, on average
over the $3-7$-year band, explained by the wavelet model. The wavelet power of deer fluctuations at scale $\sigma$ is 
$P^{(0)}_{\sigma}=\frac{1}{NT}\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{t=1}^T|W^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t)|^2$, where the $W^{(0)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$ are the 
wavelet transforms of the deer time series. We integrated this quantity over the $3-7$-year band to obtain the denominator of 
$B$. The wavelet power explained by $W^{(1)}_{i,\sigma}(t)$ (the wavelet transforms of the $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ 
time series, the 
same for all locations, $i$) at scale $\sigma$ is $|\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|^2P^{(0)}_{\sigma}$ according to our model. 
We integrated this quantity over the $3-7$-year band to obtain the numerator of $B$.
\item The third quantity ($C$) was the spatial synchrony, again measured
in a time- and band-averaged way, predicted by the wavelet model according to the wavelet
Moran theorem. This was computed by: 1) starting 
with $|\Pi^{(01)}_{\sigma}|^2\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} |r^{(\text{wmf},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2$; and then 
2) averaging over times, and then timescales in the 
$3-7$-year band. Note, however, that $\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} |r^{(\text{wmf},1)}_{\sigma}(t)|^2=1$,
so this is an average of the squared spatial wavelet coherence. 
\end{enumerate}
For the real data, these three quantities were,
respectively, $0.530557437095931$, $0.418327023890617$, and $0.364288221245834$, and we denote these values
by $A_0$, $B_0$, and $C_0$, respectively. We denote by $A(\sqrt{V},c)$ the median, over $1000$ simulations,
of the first quantity described above for the simulations. Likewise $B(\sqrt{V},c)$ and $C(\sqrt{V},c)$ 
denote medians over $1000$ simulations of the second and third quantities above. 
Agreement between actual and simulation-based quantities was judged with fractional deviations, 
$|A(\sqrt{V},c)-A_0|/A_0$, $|B(\sqrt{V},c)-B_0|/B_0$ and $|C(\sqrt{V},c)-C_0|/C_0$.

For each parameter set $(\sqrt{V},c)$ for which $A(\sqrt{V},c)$, $B(\sqrt{V},c)$
and $C(\sqrt{V},c)$ were determined, as above, to match adequately with 
$A_0$, $B_0$ and $C_0$, respectively, we calculated the median fraction of synchrony 
apparently explained in the 36 year models, and then simulated a further 10000 years of data 
and refitted to get a reliable estimate of synchrony explained, thereby 
giving us an estimate of the factor by which apparent synchrony explained was inflated.
Synchrony explained was as in (\ref{eq:syncexpl}), averaged over $3-7$-year timescales.

\subsection{ Randomization procedure for removing synchrony at $3-7$-year timescales}\label{SI:methods:surrogs} 
\noindent In order to quantify the degree to which 
synchronizing effects are responsible for 
fluctuations in statewide total deer and DVC time 
series (main text Fig. \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations} and associated text), 
we adapted the standard Fourier surrogate procedure 
of @Theiler1992. We constructed artificial 
deer abundance and DVC time series for each 
location, having the same variance and spectral 
characteristics as the original data but no spatial 
synchrony in the $3-7$-year timescale band of 
interest. Components of variability and synchrony 
outside this band (such as longer-term trends or 
fluctuations, and higher-frequency components 
associated with 'spikiness' in the data) were left 
unchanged. To produce surrogate data for a given 
location, we took the Fourier transform of the time 
series and randomized the phases of the Fourier 
components inside the $3-7$-year timescale band 
before inverse transforming to produce the 
surrogate time series. Because only phases of the 
Fourier transform were randomized, power spectra and 
variances of time series are unchanged. 
Additionally, because phases in the $3-7$-year 
timescale band are randomized independently, 
surrogate time series so produced no longer exhibit 
a tendency to synchrony in the $3-7$-year timescale 
range [@Schreiber2000]. Phase randomization was 
accomplished by adding a random and uniformly distributed phase increment 
between $0$ and $2\pi$ to the phase of each Fourier 
component with a frequency greater than or equal to 
$1/7$, but less than $1/3$ cycles per year. 
Additionally, because the phase values of the 
Fourier components of a real signal are 
anti-symmetric about the Nyquist frequency ($1/2$ 
cycles/year), Fourier components with frequencies 
less than or equal to $6/7$ and more than $2/3$ 
cycles per year had the same set of phase 
increments subtracted to preserve the anti-symmetry 
property of Fourier transforms. We summed each set 
of surrogate time series spatially to produce a 
surrogate state-total time series representative of 
the hypothetical case in which $3-7$-year timescale 
synchrony was absent. Such surrogate state-total 
time series were compared to the actual time series 
(deer abundance or DVCs) to show the nature of the 
additional variance in the state-total time series 
that was attributable to synchrony (main text Fig. \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations}).

\subsection{ Details on estimating approximate monetary impact of DVCs}\label{SI:methods:DVCimpact} 
\noindent We estimated the approximate monetary impact of 
synchrony in DVCs based on several reported 
assumptions about DVCs. Using an average difference in DVCs
between peak and trough years 
(main text Fig. \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations}) of `r avgdvcfluc`, and if we assume 
that each reported DVC results in an average of 
US\$2024 of damage [@Conover2011_bookchp], the 
difference in damages statewide between peak and 
trough years is more than US\$5M. Given that DVCs 
may be only reported about 50% of the time 
[@Marcoux2010_dvc], this number is actually likely 
greater than US\$10M. Using different assumptions 
of the cost of DVCs [@Huijser2008_dvc], the 
difference between peak and trough years in DVC 
costs may exceed US\$22M.    


# Supplementary results \label{SI:results}

\subsection{Fraction of deer synchrony explained by $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$, county data, technical results}\label{SI:results:} 
\noindent Of the parameters 
considered (SI section \ref{SI:methods}), there were five parameter combinations 
$(\sqrt{V},c)$ for which the sum of the squares of the fractional deviations
$|A(\sqrt{V},c)-A_0|/A_0$, $|B(\sqrt{V},c)-B_0|/B_0$ and $|C(\sqrt{V},c)-C_0|/C_0$ was less than $0.005$
(Fig. \ref{InflationFig}, Table \ref{InflationTable}), and for those parameter combinations the indivual fractional 
deviations were always less than $0.06$. Thus parameters were available for which our model gave reasonable
agreement with the actual data in the three ways for which agreement was tested. For these parameters,
synchrony explained, as estimated using 36 years of data, was between $1.1885$ and $1.3050$ greater than 
an unbiased estimate of synchrony explained using 10000 years of simulated data (Table \ref{InflationTable}).
These are synchrony inflation factors, and they describe the extent to which our estimates of the fraction of 
deer synchrony explained by $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ may have been inflated. Averaging across the parameter sets used, 
the factor by which synchrony 
explained was estimated to be inflated when using 36-year data was $1.2528$. Thus our prior, naive 
estimate, based solely on the wavelet Moran theorem, that $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ explained $`r round(abunwmeiSyncExp37)`\%$
of deer abundance synchrony was probably an overestimate by approximately $25\%$; an adjusted 
value was $`r round(abunwmeiSyncExp37/1.2528)`\%$.
This adjusted quantity is still substantial. As mentioned briefly in the corresponding section of 
SI section \ref{SI:methods}, we repeated our analysis using an AR(1) model for deer dynamics, obtaining very
similar inflation factor results under that alternative assumption.

\subsection{USDA district results} \label{SI:results:districts}
\noindent Using district-level data, deer abundance 
again showed a prominent synchrony feature at $3-7$-year 
timescales, similar to the county-level analysis 
(Fig. \ref{FigS7_WMFAndPredictionsDistricts}A,C). Deer abundance was significantly related to $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$, 
and was marginally significantly related to $\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$ on $3-7$-year timescales
(Table \ref{TabS2_SummaryDistrict}). Deer abundance was significantly related to snow depth on $3-4$-year timescales. These variables were the same ones identified as 
significantly coherent with deer abundance using 
county-level data. 
The phase relationships 
between these variables and deer abundance were also very similar 
to county-level relationships: snow depth and 
deer abundance were nearly in anti-phase; and climate 
indices and deer abundance showed approximately 
quarter-cycle phase shifts (Table \ref{TabS2_SummaryDistrict}). 

The climate indices explained similar amounts of 
deer abundance synchrony as for the county-level 
data (Table \ref{TabS2_SummaryDistrict}). Cross terms for snow depth and deer abundance over 
$3-4$-year timescales were nearly too large at the county level to make a reliable statement of 
synchrony explained at that level, but cross terms were not too large for the district-level 
analysis, and snow depth explained $`r round(usda_abunsnwd_syncexp34,0)`\%$ of synchrony at 
$3-4$-year timescales. This makes sense in light of possible effects of dispersal at smaller 
spatial scales, as explained in the section "Wavelet Moran theorem..." above; effects of dispersal 
would have been reduced at district level because a smaller proportion of deer disperse between 
spatial units for larger spatial units.
The result that snow depth appeared to influence deer on $3-4$-year timescales, while 
$\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ and $\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$ were significantly spatially coherent and 
explained synchrony at $4-7$-year timescales pertained to district-level data as it did for 
county-level data.

As in the county-level analyses, hunter abundance time series were not spatially coherent with deer abundance time series on $3-7$-year timescales (Table \ref{TabS2_SummaryDistrict}), so any synchrony there may have been in hunter abundances at those timescales could not have explained synchrony in deer. Again similar to the county-level analyses, hunter abundance time series were significantly coherent with deer abundance on $2-2.5$-year timescales (Table \ref{TabS2_SummaryDistrict}), but there was little deer abundance synchrony on those timescales to explain (Fig. \ref{FigS7_WMFAndPredictionsDistricts}A,C).

DVC data aggregated to USDA districts had a similar 
synchrony feature to deer abundance over $3-7$ year 
timescales (Fig. \ref{FigS7_WMFAndPredictionsDistricts}B,D). As 
at county level, deer abundance time series were significantly spatially coherent with DVC time series on $3-7$-year timescales (Table \ref{TabS2_SummaryDistrict}).
Whereas cross terms were high enough at county-level to render meaningless statements about fractions of DVC synchrony explained by deer synchrony, this was not the case at district level: cross terms were low (Table \ref{TabS2_SummaryDistrict}), and fractions of DVC synchrony explained by deer synchrony were $`r round(usda_dvcabunSyncExp,0)`\%$ for raw DVC data and $`r round(usda_adjdvcabunSyncExp,0)`\%$ for traffic-adjusted DVCs. The difference in cross terms between county- and district-level analyses again makes sense in light of dispersal, as explained above. Large cross terms may reflect the 
effects on the statistics of dispersal of 
deer between counties or movements of cars between 
counties, but such effects would be
reduced at the larger district level because reduced fractions of deer and cars disperse from one spatial unit to another for these larger spatial units. 
Patterns of synchrony in DVCs predicted by synchrony in deer looked similar to actual patterns of synchrony in DVCs (Fig. \ref{FigS7_WMFAndPredictionsDistricts}E). 

\subsection{Statewide results} \label{SI:methods:statewide}
\noindent For statewide analyses, for which all 
variables were represented only by single, state-average or 
total time series rather than spatiotemporal data, timescale-specific relationships 
between variables were tested using ordinary 
wavelet coherence. Wavelet coherence is a 
non-spatial version of the spatial wavelet coherence, and 
tests whether two time series exhibit consistent 
phase differences and correlated magnitudes of 
oscillation through time, as a function of 
timescale. We tested for relationships between 
statewide deer abundance time series and climate 
indices, statewide averages for winter weather, 
statewide hunter abundance time series, and 
statewide total DVCs. The same functions in the `wsyn` package listed above for spatial wavelet coherence were used, as they can compute both ordinary wavelet coherence and spatial wavelet coherence.

In general, results of statewide analyses 
mostly agreed with the smaller-spatial-unit 
analyses, when they could be compared. Results on synchrony were not available at state level because at that level each variable is only represented by a single time series, but we compared wavelet coherence results between variables at the statewide spatial scale to spatial wavelet coherence results between variables using smaller spatial units. Statewide deer abundance and DVC time series were marginally 
significantly coherent over $3-7$-year timescales 
($P = `r round(ann.dvc.abun_pval,4)`$), with the strongest relationship occurring over 
$3-5$-year timescales ($P = `r round(ann.dvc.abun_pval35,4)`$). 
$\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ and $\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$ were significantly 
coherent with deer abundance over the $3-7$-year 
timescale band ($\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$, $P = `r round(ann.abun.wmei_pval,4)`$; 
$\text{PDO}_{\text{w}}$, $P = `r round(ann.abun.wpdo_pval,4)`$). Snow depth was not 
significant over $3-7$-year timescales ($P = `r round(ann.abun.snow_pval37,4)`$), but 
was significant at $3-4$-year timescales ($P = `r round(ann.abun.snow_pval34,4)`$), 
consistent with the results at other spatial resolutions. 
Hunter abundance and deer 
abundance were not significantly coherent at the 
state level on $3-7$-year timescales ($P = `r round(ann.abun.hunter_pval37,4)`$) or $2-2.5$-year timescales ($P = `r round(ann.abun.hunter_pval2_2.5,4)`$).

# Alternative analyses: methods \label{sect:alt_methods}

\noindent Fourier methods were used in our theory (main text and SI section \ref{SI:theory})
and wavelet methods were used in analyses of data (main text and SI sections \ref{SI:methods} and \ref{SI:results}),
which may be perceived as a mismatch. Though we do not think there is as mismatch, this section and SI section 
\ref{sect:alt_results} are devoted to an alternative set of empirical analyses using purely Fourier methods. All
main wavelet results were also supported by the Fourier approach, strengthening our overall argument.

It was appropriate, for several reasons, to use Fourier methods for 
the theory and wavelet methods for the data analyses of the main text - there is no mismatch. First, both sets of methods are
spectral methods, and are closely related and serve similar goals. 
Our methods, based on the continuous Morlet wavelet transform, can be derived from Fourier methods and can be defined in terms of Fourier transforms.
Second, differences
that do exist between the two approaches are consistent with differences between 
theory and empirical analyses. Fourier analyses make more structural assumptions, notably, they
assume stationarity of time series. But extensive analytic machinery is also available with Fourier analyses, under these assumptions. 
It was appropriate to develop our theoretical approach under a set of simplifying assumptions that 
made possible the use of powerful mathematical tools, leading to analytic results.
We then used wavelet methods, which do not assume stationarity and are more suited to the 
complexities of real data, for empirical work. Wavelet methods have been applied recently in work on
the timescale specificity of synchrony, and these tools have been frequently shown, in recent years, to be useful for such 
investigations [@Sheppard2016_aphids;@Walter2017_geogsync;@Anderson2019_LO;@Sheppard_wavmodel;@Walter_etal_2019;@Walter_etal_InPress].
Wavelet methods provide detailed visualizations, and tracking of time-varying features that is difficult under a traditional Fourier approach. 

Although we again emphasize that Fourier and wavelet approaches are so closely related that we do not
see a mismatch, we nevertheless still provide a complete set of Fourier-only analyses as additional support for our conclusions. 
In the main text, we argued that 
timescale-specific synchrony causes cycles in deer and DVC data via the following overarching logical
steps: 1) we showed that synchrony in both deer and DVCs is timescale specific,
occurring principally on $3-7$-year timescales (Figs \ref{MT-Fig3_DeerSync}, \ref{MT-Fig4_DvcSync}, \ref{FigS7_WMFAndPredictionsDistricts});
2) we showed that patterns of deer and DVC synchrony are due to timescale-specific Moran effects (Tables \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary},
\ref{TabS2_SummaryDistrict}, Figs \ref{FigS4_PhaseDiffs}, \ref{FigS5_RanksInSurrogs}); and 3) we showed 
state-level cycles were a result of timescale-specific synchrony (Fig. \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations}).
The alternative Fourier approach of this section and SI section \ref{sect:alt_results} follows the same overarching logical steps. 
These steps correspond to the subsections below, as well as to the subsections of SI section \ref{sect:alt_results}. 

\subsection{How to show that patterns of synchrony in deer and DVCs are timescale specific}\label{sect:FourierTSSync}

\noindent We used a Fourier synchrony measure that produces as output a plot that shows strength
of synchrony between several time series as a function of frequency, $f$. We now describe the measure. 
Suppose data are available for population indices $w_i(t)$ for locations $i=1,\ldots,N$ and
times $t=1,\ldots,T$ and these data have been pre-treated to detrend,
normalize location marginal distributions, and standardize variance to $1$ for
all location time series (as described in Methods in the main text). One standard [@Leibhold2004_sync]
measure of synchrony is
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{N(N-1)}\sum_{i \neq j} \cor(w_i(t),w_j(t)),
\end{equation}
\noindent where the correlation (Pearson correlation is typically used) is computed over
time, and the sum is over the ranges $i=1,\ldots,N$ and $j=1,\ldots,N$. But variance
standardization means this equals
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{N(N-1)}\sum_{i \neq j} \cov(w_i(t),w_j(t)).\label{eq:nonfssyncmeasure}
\end{equation}
\noindent Decomposing by frequencies, $f$, this measure of population synchrony is succeeded by the frequency-specific measure
\begin{equation}
\rho_w (f) = \frac{1}{N(N-1)}\sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j}(f)=\frac{1}{N(N-1)}\sum_{i \neq j} S_{w_i w_j}(f),
\end{equation}
\noindent where we remind the reader that $S_{w_i w_j}$ is the cross spectrum and $C_{w_i w_j}=\Rp(S_{w_i w_j})$ is the cospectrum
of $w_i$ and $w_j$.
These quantities were estimated from available data using the consistent estimator of @Brillinger2001 (section 7.4 
of that text). 
The frequency-specific metric, $\rho_w (f)$, can be appropriately integrated across frequencies to recover the 
non-frequency-specific metric, (\ref{eq:nonfssyncmeasure}). The analogous quantity
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\epsilon} (f) = \frac{1}{N(N-1)}\sum_{i \neq j} C_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_j}(f)=\frac{1}{N(N-1)}\sum_{i \neq j} S_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_j}(f)
\end{equation}
\noindent can be defined for an environmental variable, $\epsilon$, measured in all locations $i$.

The statistical significance of $\rho_w (f)$ was assessed via the standard Fourier surrogate procedure of 
@Theiler1992. We constructed artificial deer abundance and (separately) DVC time series for each location,
each time series having the same variance and spectral characteristics as the original data, but with no synchrony
between the time series from different locations.
The approach was similar to that described in SI section \ref{SI:methods:surrogs}, but Fourier phases for all 
timescales were randomized (independently for each time series), not just those in the $3-7$-year 
band (as was done in SI section \ref{SI:methods:surrogs}). The quantity $\rho_w (f)$ was compared to the distribution 
of values of the same statistic computed for $10000$ of these surrogates. For frequencies for which the value of $\rho_w (f)$ for data
rose above the $95$th quantile of values for surrogates, $\rho_w (f)$ was considered significant.

We also judged if peaks in $\rho_w (f)$ represented significant spectral features, and therefore if synchrony was timescale specific, 
by comparing $\rho_w (f)$ for real data to 
values of the same statistic computed for a second type of surrogate. To produce one surrogate dataset of
this second type, the values $w_i(t)$ were randomly permuted, using the same permutation for each
sampling location, $i$. Synchrony as measured using standard correlation and covariance measures 
was unchanged for such a surrogate dataset, but synchrony was distributed evenly across frequencies for these surrogates,
up to sampling variation. We plotted $\rho_w (f)$ for real data and for surrogates on the same axes, to compare. 
When $\rho_w (f)$ rose above the $97.5$th quantile of surrogate values, synchrony at the corresponding frequencies
was higher that could reasonably have been the case if synchrony were evenly distributed across frequencies. When 
$\rho_w (f)$ sank below the $2.5$th quantile of surrogate values, synchrony at the corresponding frequencies was less than would have
been expected if synchrony were evenly distributed across frequencies. Thus this approach revealed 
timescale specificity in synchrony.

We also used a second approach to detect timescale specificity of synchrony. We compared the value 
of a "peakiness" statistic for $\rho_w (f)$, as computed using data, to values of the same
peakiness statistic computed for surrogates of the second type described above. The peakiness statistic was 
$\rho_w (f_2)-(\rho_w (f_1)+\rho_w (f_3))/2$ for $f_2$ a frequency in the middle of the peak in $\rho_w (f)$
that manifested for real data, and $f_1$ and $f_3$ frequencies on either side of the peak. The fraction of 
surrogate-based values of the peakiness statistic that exceeded the value for real data was a $p$-value for
a test of the null hypothesis that a particular peak in the plot of $\rho_w(f)$ for data was no greater than 
would have been expected by chance if synchrony were evenly distributed across frequencies. Therefore
this test examines whether synchrony was timescale specific and whether particular timescales were more synchronous.

\subsection{How to show that synchrony is due to timescale-specific Moran effects}\label{sect:FourierMoran}

\noindent We developed a Fourier framework for attributing population synchrony to environmental drivers, 
and we applied it to our deer and DVC data. We here introduce the framework
and the numeric and other methods necessary to apply it to our data. Results of applying it are in SI
section \ref{sect:FourierMoran_res}. 

\subsubsection{Theoretical framework}\label{theoretical_framework}

\noindent We begin by framing two specific population models, followed by a general mathematical framework which covers both models
as special cases.
Although the general framework does not have a straightforward ecological interpretation, the
specific models do. This approach
enables a more parsimonious presentation of mathematical results, since some results can be stated and
proved for the general framework. The model setup is similar to that of SI section \ref{SI:theory:modeltheorem}, but two
stochastic environmental factors act at once on the populations.

\textbf{The first specific model.} The first specific model is
\begin{equation}
w_i(t)=b_1 w_i(t-1)+\cdots+b_n w_i(t-n)+p_0^{(1)}\epsilon^{(1)}(t)+\cdots+p_m^{(1)}\epsilon^{(1)}(t-m)+
p_0^{(2)}\epsilon_i^{(2)}(t)+\cdots+p_m^{(2)}\epsilon_i^{(2)}(t-m),\label{eq:themodel1}
\end{equation}
\noindent with $i=1,\ldots,N$ indexing distinct habitat patches or population sampling locations.
The process $w=(w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_N)$ is an index of population density for each habitat patch.
The process $\epsilon^{(1)}$ is interpreted as a univariate climate process affecting populations in all habitat patches, whereas
the $N$-dimensional process $\epsilon^{(2)}=(\epsilon_1^{(2)},\epsilon_2^{(2)},\ldots,\epsilon_N^{(2)})$
is a local weather variable, potentially taking different values in each patch. 
The first specific model will be applied, for instance, 
to consideration of how and to what extent synchrony in deer can be attributed to MEI. 
The $w_i$ will model
deer and $\epsilon^{(1)}$ will represent MEI. The combination of other, unmeasured drivers is represented
by $\epsilon^{(2)}$.
The combined process $\epsilon=(\epsilon^{(1)},\epsilon_1^{(2)},\epsilon_2^{(2)},\ldots,\epsilon_N^{(2)})$
is assumed to be a second-order stationary stochastic process with $\E(\epsilon^{(1)})=0$ and $\E(\epsilon_i^{(2)})=0$
for $i=1,\ldots,N$. The complex roots of the polynomial
$1-b_1 z-b_2 z^2 -\cdots-b_n z^n$ are assumed to have modulus greater than $1$. We assume
$\epsilon^{(1)}$ and $w$ were measured for a finite set of times $t=1,2,\ldots,T$, but that
$\epsilon^{(2)}$ is unmeasured, influencing the populations but unknown to the human observer.
We also assume the power spectrum $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}(f)$ of $\epsilon^{(1)}$ is
nonzero for all frequencies, $f$, a reasonable assumption since most environmental signals are broadband.
We define the linear filter
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}=I_N-b_1I_NB-b_2 I_N B^2 - \cdots - b_n I_N B^n,
\end{equation}
\noindent where $I_N$ is the $N \times N$ identity matrix and $B$ is the backshift operator.
The assumption that roots of $1-b_1 z-b_2 z^2 -\cdots-b_n z^n$ have modulus greater than $1$
means $\mathcal{B}$ is an invertible filter [@Brillinger2001].
We also define the filter
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}^{(1)}=p_0^{(1)}e+p_1^{(1)} e B + \cdots + p_m^{(1)} e B^m,
\end{equation}
\noindent where $e$ is an $N \times 1$ matrix of $1$s, as well as the filter
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}^{(2)}=p_0^{(2)}I_N+p_1^{(2)} I_N B + \cdots + p_m^{(2)} I_N B^m.
\end{equation}
\noindent The model can then be written as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B} w = \mathcal{P}^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)} + \mathcal{P}^{(2)} \epsilon^{(2)},\label{eq:themodel1version2}
\end{equation}
\noindent a formulation which is more convenient for subsequent calculations with Fourier transforms
and transfer functions. See @Brillinger2001, as well as @Shumway2000, @Reinsel1997 and many other references 
for background on stochastic processes and linear filters. 

\textbf{The second specific model.} The second specific model is
\begin{equation}
w_i(t)=b_1 w_i(t-1)+\cdots+b_n w_i(t-n)+p_0^{(1)}\epsilon_i^{(1)}(t)+\cdots+p_m^{(1)}\epsilon_i^{(1)}(t-m)+
p_0^{(2)}\epsilon_i^{(2)}(t)+\cdots+p_m^{(2)}\epsilon_i^{(2)}(t-m),\label{eq:themodel2}
\end{equation}
\noindent with $i=1,\ldots,N$ again indexing distinct habitat patches or population sampling locations. The processes
$\epsilon^{(1)}=(\epsilon_1^{(1)},\epsilon_2^{(1)},\ldots,\epsilon_N^{(1)})$ and
$\epsilon^{(2)}=(\epsilon_1^{(2)},\epsilon_2^{(2)},\ldots,\epsilon_N^{(2)})$ are both local weather
variables which influence the populations $w=(w_1,\ldots,w_N)$. 
The second specific model will be applied, for instance, 
to consideration of how and to what extent synchrony in deer can be attributed to fluctuations in snow depth. 
The $w_i$ will model
deer and $\epsilon^{(1)}$ will represent snow depth (which depends on both time and location). The combination 
of other, unmeasured drivers is again represented
by $\epsilon^{(2)}$.
The combined process $\epsilon=(\epsilon_1^{(1)},\ldots,\epsilon_N^{(1)},\epsilon_1^{(2)},\ldots,\epsilon_N^{(2)})$
is assumed to be a second-order stationary stochastic process with the expected values of each component
equal to $0$. The complex roots of the polynomial
$1-b_1 z-b_2 z^2 -\cdots-b_n z^n$ are again assumed to have modulus greater than $1$.
We assume $\epsilon^{(1)}$ and $w$ were measured, in all habitat patches,
for a finite set of times $t=1,2,\ldots,T$, but that
$\epsilon^{(2)}$ is unmeasured by the human observer. We assume the spectral matrix
$S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}(f)$ of $\epsilon^{(1)}$ is nonsingular for all frequencies, $f$.
For this model, we redefine the linear filter $\mathcal{P}^{(1)}$ as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}^{(1)}=p_0^{(1)}I_N+p_1^{(1)} I_N B + \cdots + p_m^{(1)} I_N B^m,
\end{equation}
\noindent noting that the model can then be written as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B} w = \mathcal{P}^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)} + \mathcal{P}^{(2)} \epsilon^{(2)}.\label{eq:themodel2version2}
\end{equation}
\noindent The fact that (\ref{eq:themodel1version2}) and (\ref{eq:themodel2version2}) look the same (though
$\mathcal{P}^{(1)}$ and $\epsilon^{(1)}$ represent different quantities in these equations) suggests the general framework
to follow. 

\textbf{General framework.} The framework is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B} w = \mathcal{P}^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)} + \mathcal{P}^{(2)} \epsilon^{(2)},\label{eq:modelgeneral}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\epsilon^{(1)}$ and $\epsilon^{(2)}$ are now second-order stationary stochastic processes of any dimension
with all component expected values equal to $0$. We further assume that the combined stochastic process
$\epsilon= (\epsilon^{(1)},\epsilon^{(2)})$ is second-order stationary.
The filters $\mathcal{P}^{(1)}$ and $\mathcal{P}^{(2)}$ are taken to be absolutely summable.
The filter $\mathcal{B}$ is assumed to take the
special form $\mathcal{B}=I_N-b_1I_NB-b_2 I_N B^2 - \cdots - b_n I_N B^n$. The spectral matrix
$S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}(f)$ is assumed invertible for all frequencies $f$, and the complex roots
of the polynomial $1-b_1 z - b_2 z - \cdots - b_n z^n$ are assumed to have modulus greater than $1$.
The processes $\epsilon^{(1)}$ and $\epsilon^{(2)}$ are again interpreted as
measured and unmeasured processes that influence the populations, and it is assumed that the populations
were measured for the same times as were the $\epsilon_i^{(1)}$.

The general framework lacks a straightforward
ecological interpretation because the dimensions of $\epsilon^{(1)}$ and $\epsilon^{(2)}$
are arbitrary and the corresponding filters $\mathcal{P}^{(1)}$ and $\mathcal{P}^{(2)}$ are not "scalar".
When the dimension of $\epsilon^{(j)}$ is $N$ and the corresponding filter
$\mathcal{P}^{(j)}$ is a so-called scalar filter, i.e., it can be written in terms of $N \times N$ scalar
matrices and the backshift operator, it is possible to interpret $\epsilon^{(j)}$ as a local environmental
factor like local temperature or precipitation, which directly influences the local population.
On the other hand, when the dimension of $\epsilon^{(j)}$ is $1$, it is possible to interpret $\epsilon^{(j)}$
as a large-scale climatic factor. But the ecological interpretation of other arrangements
is less straightforward. Nevertheless, the general framework is useful because it includes both specific models
as special cases, so results proved for the general framework apply to both
specific models.

\textbf{The population cross spectral matrix and a Fourier Moran theorem.} To calculate $\rho_w (f)$
for our general model framework, we need $S_{w_i w_j}(f)$ for all $i \neq j$, so we here calculate
it. We start by engineering a simplification to the model.
Let $A=S_{\epsilon^{(2)} \epsilon^{(1)}} S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1}$. Now let $\mathcal{A}$ be the filter
with transfer function $A$. This filter exists and is absolutely summable (see theorem
8.3.1 of @Brillinger2001).
Now let $\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}=\epsilon^{(2)}-
\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}$, so $\epsilon^{(2)}=\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}+\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}$.
So our population model becomes
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B} w = \widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}} \epsilon^{(1)} + \mathcal{P}^{(2)} \widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}},\label{eq:modelaftervariablechange}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}}=\mathcal{P}^{(1)}+\mathcal{P}^{(2)}\mathcal{A}$.
The benefit of making this change of variable is that $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}}=0$,
whereas $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(2)}}$ was not necessarily $0$. This will be important below.

Now taking the spectral matrix of both sides of (\ref{eq:modelaftervariablechange}), we get
\begin{equation}
T(\mathcal{B}) S_{ww} T(\mathcal{B})^* = T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})
S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}} T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})^* +
T(\mathcal{P}^{(2)})
S_{\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}} \widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}} T(\mathcal{P}^{(2)})^*\label{eq:modeltransformed}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $T$ represents the transfer function of a filter and the superscript $*$ indicates
conjugate transpose. There are no cross-spectral terms on the right side of
(\ref{eq:modeltransformed}) because
$S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}}=S_{\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}} \epsilon^{(1)}}=0$, by design.
Equation (\ref{eq:modeltransformed}) then becomes
\begin{equation}
S_{ww} = T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}) T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})
S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}} T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})^* T(\mathcal{B}^{-1})^* +
T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}) T(\mathcal{P}^{(2)})
S_{\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}} \widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}} T(\mathcal{P}^{(2)})^* T(\mathcal{B}^{-1})^*,\label{eq:twopartspectralmat}
\end{equation}
\noindent which gives $S_{w_i w_j}(f)$ for all $i \neq j$, as desired. The first summand on the right
in (\ref{eq:twopartspectralmat}) is the portion of the spectral matrix of $w$
statistically attributable
to $\epsilon^{(1)}$ (more below on what, precisely, we mean by "statistically attributable"), and the second summand is the portion attributable to
$\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}$. The first summand includes contributions due directly to
$\epsilon^{(1)}$, as well as contributions due to $\epsilon^{(2)}$ that "line up" with
the contributions due directly to $\epsilon^{(1)}$ (see below).
These cannot be separated, since $\epsilon^{(2)}$ was not measured.
Our expression for $S_{ww}$ leads to the following:

\begin{thm}\label{thm:FMT}
\textbf{\emph{Fourier Moran theorem.}} Given the general model framework and notation described in the previous text, the portion of synchrony, $\rho_w (f)$, in the population process $w$ that can be statistically attributed to the measured noise
$\epsilon^{(1)}$ can be obtained by summing the off-diagonal elements of the matrix
\begin{equation}
M=T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}) T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})
S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}} T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})^* T(\mathcal{B}^{-1})^* \label{eq:contrib}
\end{equation}
\noindent and then dividing by $N(N-1)$. The matrix (\ref{eq:contrib}) equals
\begin{equation}
M=S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}} S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1} S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}^*,
\label{eq:contrib2}
\end{equation}
\noindent which depends only on the measured quantities $w$ and
$\epsilon^{(1)}$. So to estimate the portion of synchrony, $\rho_w (f)$, in the population process $w$ that can be statistically attributed to the measured noise
$\epsilon^{(1)}$, it suffices to estimate (\ref{eq:contrib2}), sum
the off-diagonal entries of the estimate, and divide the result by $N(N-1)$.
We henceforth
denote this quantity by $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$. It can be compared to $\rho_w(f)$ to understand the fraction of 
synchrony attributable to $\epsilon^{(1)}$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
We have
\begin{equation}
\rho_w (f) = \frac{1}{N(N-1)} \sum_{i \neq j} S_{w_i w_j}.
\end{equation}
But according to (\ref{eq:twopartspectralmat}), the portion of $S_{ww}$ statistically
attributable to $\epsilon^{(1)}$ is the matrix
\begin{equation}
M=T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}) T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})
S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}} T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})^* T(\mathcal{B}^{-1})^*.\label{eq:Mexpr1}
\end{equation}
So, summing the entries $M_{ij}$ of this matrix over all $i \neq j$ and dividing
by $N(N-1)$ gives the portion of $\rho_w (f)$ statistically attributable to $\epsilon^{(1)}$.

To show that $M=S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}} S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1} S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}^*$, note that
\begin{equation}
w= \mathcal{B}^{-1} \widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}} \epsilon^{(1)} +
\mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(2)} \widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}},
\end{equation}
so, by taking the cross spectrum of both sides of this equation with $\epsilon^{(1)}$,
\begin{align}
S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}} &= T(\mathcal{B}^{-1} \widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})
S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}} + T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)})
S_{\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}} \epsilon^{(1)}} \\
&= T(\mathcal{B}^{-1} \widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})
S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}.\label{eq:needed}
\end{align}
Therefore we have
\begin{equation}
T(\mathcal{B}^{-1} \widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}}) = S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}
S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Substituting into (\ref{eq:Mexpr1}), this gives
\begin{align}
M &= T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}) T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})
S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}} T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})^* T(\mathcal{B}^{-1})^* \label{eq:expressionforM}\\
&= S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}} S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1}
S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}
(S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}} S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1})^* \\
&= S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}} S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1} S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}^*,
\end{align}
as was to be proved.
\end{proof}
\noindent As was the case for $S_{ww}$, note that the portion of $\rho_w (f)$ "statistically attributable" to $\epsilon^{(1)}$
includes a portion due to the component of $\epsilon^{(2)}$ that happens to "line up"
with $\epsilon^{(1)}$. This is unavoidable, since $\epsilon^{(2)}$ was not measured.
The issue is explored in more detail below.

\textbf{Interpreting the Fourier Moran theorem for the first specific model.} For the first specific 
model, for which $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}(f)$ was assumed to be a non-zero
scalar quantity for each frequency $f$, the matrix $M$ of the Fourier Moran theorem takes the form
\begin{align}
M &= S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}} S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1} S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}^* \\
&= S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1} S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}} S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}^* \\
&= S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1} \left[ S_{w_i \epsilon^{(1)}} \overline{S_{w_j \epsilon^{(1)}}} \right]_{ij}.
\end{align}
\noindent Adding up all the off-diagonal entries of $M$ reveals the following corollary.

\begin{corl}
For the first specific model, the portion of population synchrony statistically attributable to $\epsilon^{(1)}$ is
\begin{equation}
\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}=\frac{1}{N(N-1)S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}}\sum_{i \neq j} S_{w_i \epsilon^{(1)}} \overline{S_{w_j \epsilon^{(1)}}}.
\end{equation}
\end{corl}
\noindent This quantity should typically be straightforward to estimate from available data using standard tools for estimating 
cross spectra [@Brillinger2001]. 

Given data, plotting estimates of $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ and $\rho_w$ on the same axes
gives an indication of how much of the population synchrony can be attributed to $\epsilon^{(1)}$, and how that 
varies with timescale.
Given a timescale band, summing the values of an estimate of $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$ across frequencies
corresponding to timescales in the band, and also summing values of an estimate of $\rho_w(f)$ in the same way, and then taking the 
quotient, can be interpreted as the overall fraction of population synchrony in the 
band which was statistically attributable to $\epsilon^{(1)}$. Thus our Fourier Moran theorem can help illuminate the extent to which
deer synchrony may be due to MEI. 

\textbf{Interpreting the Fourier Moran theorem for the second specific model, a special case.} For the second 
specific model, $\mathcal{A}$ is an $N \times N$ filter. In the special case for which $\mathcal{A}$ is a scalar filter, i.e., 
the case for which $\mathcal{A}$ can be 
written in terms of scalar matrices and the backshift operator, $B$
(or, equivalently, its transfer function, $A$, is a scalar matrix), then because
$\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}}=\mathcal{P}^{(1)}+\mathcal{P}^{(2)}\mathcal{A}$ and because $\mathcal{P}^{(1)}$ and
$\mathcal{P}^{(2)}$ are scalar filters, $\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}}$ is also a scalar filter.
The filter $\mathcal{B}$ is also scalar. Therefore
$T(\mathcal{B}^{-1})T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})=T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})$ is a
scalar matrix, which we denote $\alpha I_N$. Applying this to expression (\ref{eq:expressionforM})
for $M$ gives $M=|\alpha|^2 S_{\epsilon^{(1)}\epsilon^{(1)}}$, which leads to the following corollary.

\begin{corl}
For the second specific model,
and additionally assuming that $\mathcal{A}$ is a scalar filter, the portion of population synchrony 
statistically attributable to $\epsilon^{(1)}$ equals
\begin{equation}
\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)=\left| \frac{S_{w_i \epsilon_j^{(1)}}}{S_{\epsilon_i^{(1)} \epsilon_j^{(1)}}} \right|^2 \rho_{\epsilon^{(1)}}(f),\label{eq:maineqspecialMoran}
\end{equation}
for any $i$ and $j$.
\end{corl}
\begin{proof}
As argued above, under the listed assumptions, $T(\mathcal{B}^{-1})T(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})=T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}\widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})$
is a scalar matrix $\alpha I_N$. But, by (\ref{eq:needed}),
$S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}=T(\mathcal{B}^{-1} \widetilde{\mathcal{P}^{(1)}})S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}$,
so $S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}=\alpha S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}$, and $\alpha = \frac{S_{w_i \epsilon_j^{(1)}}}{S_{\epsilon_i^{(1)} \epsilon_j^{(1)}}}$ for any $i$ and $j$. But, as argued above,
$M=|\alpha|^2 S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}$, so
$M=\left| \frac{S_{w_i \epsilon_j^{(1)}}}{S_{\epsilon_i^{(1)} \epsilon_j^{(1)}}} \right|^2 S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}$.
Summing over all off-diagonal entries of this matrix and applying theorem \ref{thm:FMT} gives the desired result.
\end{proof}
\noindent This special-case Fourier Moran theorem has the pleasing property
that the portion of $\rho_w$ explained
by $\epsilon^{(1)}$ is a simple product of a prefactor times the noise synchrony $\rho_{\epsilon^{(1)}}$.
We note also that (\ref{eq:maineqspecialMoran}) should be straightforward to estimate
from available data using standard spectral tools. 

\textbf{What we mean by "statistically attributable".} The population model is expressible as
\begin{align}
w &= \mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)} + \mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(2)} \epsilon^{(2)} \\
&= \mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)} + \mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(2)} (\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}} + \mathcal{A} \epsilon^{(1)}) \\
&= \mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)} + \mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(2)} \mathcal{A} \epsilon^{(1)} + \mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(2)} \widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}.
\end{align}
\noindent Taking spectral matrices of both sides and making use of the fact that
$S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}} = S_{\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}} \epsilon^{(1)}} = 0$, we have
\begin{align}
S_{ww} &= S_{\mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)},\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(1)}\epsilon^{(1)}} \label{eq:E1}\\
&+ S_{\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)}\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)},\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)}\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}} \label{eq:E2}\\
&+ S_{\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)}\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}},\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)}\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}} \label{eq:E3}\\
&+ S_{\mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)},\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)}\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}} \label{eq:E4}\\
&+ S_{\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)}\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)},\mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}. \label{eq:E5}
\end{align}
\noindent This also equals
\begin{align}
S_{ww} &= T(\mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(1)}) S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}} T(\mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(1)})^* \label{eq:star1}\\
&+ T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)}) S_{\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)},\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}} T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)})^* \label{eq:star2}\\
&+ T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)}) S_{\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}} T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)})^* \label{eq:star3}\\
&+ T(\mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(1)}) S_{\epsilon^{(1)},\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}} T(\mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathcal{P}^{(2)})^* \label{eq:star4}\\
&+ T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(2)}) S_{\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)},\epsilon^{(1)}} T(\mathcal{B}^{-1}\mathcal{P}^{(1)})^*.\label{eq:star5}
\end{align}
\noindent Note that, for the second specific model, 
all the transfer functions in (\ref{eq:star1})-(\ref{eq:star5}) are scalar matrices, and hence commute
with the spectral matrices they multiply. Thus (\ref{eq:star1})-(\ref{eq:star5}) could be reduced to a simple
expression for $S_{ww}$ in terms of the model coefficients listed in (\ref{eq:themodel1}) and the spectral
and cross-spectral matrices $S_{\epsilon^{(1)}\epsilon^{(1)}}$, $S_{\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)},\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}}$,
$S_{\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}}$, $S_{\epsilon^{(1)},\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}}$, and
$S_{\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)},\epsilon^{(1)}}$. We do not take the trouble to write these equations out because
the assumption that only $w$ and $\epsilon^{(1)}$ were measured reduces their usefulness.

The terms (\ref{eq:E1})-(\ref{eq:E5}), or, equivalently, (\ref{eq:star1})-(\ref{eq:star5}), are interpretable as
distinct contributions to $S_{ww}$, as follows. The term (\ref{eq:E1}) is the direct contribution of $\epsilon^{(1)}$.
The term (\ref{eq:E2}) is the direct contribution of $\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}$ to $S_{ww}$, which is the
contribution of the component of $\epsilon^{(2)}$ that is left when one removes the part of $\epsilon^{(2)}$
that is orthogonal to $\epsilon^{(1)}$, i.e., when one removes $\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}$.
The term (\ref{eq:E3}) is the direct contribution of $\widetilde{\epsilon^{(2)}}$ to $S_{ww}$.
The terms (\ref{eq:E4}) and (\ref{eq:E5}) are contributions to $S_{ww}$ of interactions between $\epsilon^{(1)}$
and $\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}$, i.e., between $\epsilon^{(1)}$ and the component of $\epsilon^{(2)}$ that remains
after removing the part orthogonal to $\epsilon^{(1)}$. Some of these quantities cannot be estimated from the
data we have assumed are available (data on $w$ and $\epsilon^{(1)}$). However, it is straightforward to show
that the sum of (\ref{eq:E1}), (\ref{eq:E2}), (\ref{eq:E4}), and (\ref{eq:E5}) equals the matrix $M$ of a previous section.
Thus the portion of $S_{ww}$ considered "statistically attributable" to $\epsilon^{(1)}$ consists of
direct contributions of $\epsilon^{(1)}$, direct contributions of $\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}$, and interaction
terms between $\epsilon^{(1)}$ and $\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}$. The process $\mathcal{A}\epsilon^{(1)}$ is, again,
the part of $\epsilon^{(2)}$ that remains after the component of $\epsilon^{(2)}$ that is orthogonal to $\epsilon^{(1)}$ (i.e.,
has $0$ cross spectrum with it) is removed. It is impossible to separate the contributions
(\ref{eq:E1}), (\ref{eq:E2}), (\ref{eq:E4}), and (\ref{eq:E5}) without measurements of $\epsilon^{(2)}$ or
\emph{a priori} knowledge of model coefficients, in essence because it is impossible to separate the effects of
any variable from the effects of an unmeasured variable that is partially coincident with the first variable - the combination
of these influences will always be attributed to the measured variable. 

\subsubsection{How to tell whether the framework is suitable for our data}\label{suitable_framework}

\noindent In order to apply our first specific model to our deer time series
(as $w$ in (\ref{eq:themodel1})) and to our MEI time series (as $\epsilon^{(1)}$ in (\ref{eq:themodel1}); all time series
detrended, normalized, and variance-standardized prior to application of the model), we need to first consider whether model 
assumptions are adequately met by the data. But this turns out to be essentially automatic, as we here explain.
Likewise the second specific model is applicable to our deer (as $w$) and snow-depth (as $\epsilon^{(1)}$) time series, 
and, seperately, to our DVC (as $w$) and deer (as $\epsilon^{(1)}$) time series. The reason our first and second specific models apply to
our data essentially boils down to the fact that these models are flexible: the unknown process $\epsilon^{(2)}$
is allowed to be any second-order stationary process, and the application of the models and the Fourier Moran theorem
to our data does not hinge on any specific characteristics of $\epsilon^{(2)}$. Likewise, the 
application of our theory to our data does not hinge on
what specific values of the parameters $b_1,\ldots,b_n$ and $p_0^{(1)},\ldots,p_m^{(1)}$ turn out to be the right values to render our models 
optimal for our data: in the end the only quantities our Fourier Moran approach makes use of are the spectral matrix
of $\epsilon^{(1)}$ and the cross spectral matrix of $w$ and $\epsilon^{(1)}$, which can be computed without first 
determining model parameters. 

After selecting reasonable values for $n$ and $m$, regression could be used to choose reasonable values for $b_1,\ldots,b_n$
and $p_0^{(1)},\ldots,p_m^{(1)}$. Then $\epsilon^{(2)}$ could be simply defined as $\mathcal{B}w-\mathcal{P}^{(1)}\epsilon^{(1)}$
and $\mathcal{P}^{(2)}$ could be taken to be the identity filter. By construction, the model equation 
$\mathcal{B}w=\mathcal{P}^{(1)}\epsilon^{(1)}+\mathcal{P}^{(2)}\epsilon^{(2)}$ then holds, and it is reasonable to
apply the modelling framework. Since pre-treatment of the data makes it reasonable to assume 
$w$ and $\epsilon^{(1)}$ are second-order stationary stochastic processes, $\epsilon^{(2)}$, thus defined, is also a second-order
stationary process, as assumed. 
We do not actually have to determine the most appropriate values of $b_1,\ldots,b_n$ and $p_0^{(1)},\ldots,p_m^{(1)}$ in 
order to apply our approach since all we need is the spectral matrices $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}$ and 
$S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}$. We tested our assumption that $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}$ is non-zero for $\epsilon^{(1)}$
representing MEI, and our assumption that $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}$ is invertible for $\epsilon^{(1)}$
representing snow depth, or deer abundance, from subsets of sampling locations (see SI section \ref{numerics_model2} for the reasons
subsets were used). We found these assumptions to be supported. We also verified that, for reasonable choices of
$b_1,\ldots,b_n$, the complex roots of the polynomial $1-b_1 z- \cdots - b_n z^n$ all have modulus greater than 1, as assumed (see below).

Although the above logic is sound, we also carried out some elementary cross correlation analyses and lagged regression analyses
to further support our choice to model deer in terms of snow depth and MEI using some concrete and commonly used tools. Average (across locations)
correlation between deer and snow depth was computed for various lags, and compared to distributions of the same statistics for surrogate datasets
for which Fourier phases of the snow data were randomized while retaining the spatial and temporal autocorrelation properties of the data. 
Spatial autocorrelation properties of the data were retained in the surrogates because the same phase randomization was used, for a given frequency, 
in all sampling locations. 
Similar analyses were also carried out comparing deer and MEI, and deer and DVCs. The same analyses were also repeated
after pre-filtering time series to retain only the variation occurring on the timescale bands of interest (in the $3-7$-year range). 
Regressions were also carried out of deer against lagged deer, snow depth and MEI (lags up to 3 years). 
Results (SI section \ref{Crosscorr_and_regression}) provide additional support for the overall contention that our modelling 
frameworks are adequately suited to our data, i.e., that it makes sense to model deer population data using an autoregressive 
process influenced by snow depth and MEI. Parameters determined through regressions were used to test whether the complex roots of 
the polynomial $1-b_1 z- \cdots - b_n z^n$ have modulus greater than 1.

\subsubsection{Numeric and significance procedures associated with the first specific model}\label{numerics_model1}

\noindent We applied our first specific model of SI section \ref{theoretical_framework} to deer populations (modelled as $w$) 
and MEI (modelled as $\epsilon^{(1)}$). 
Given data, and as specified in SI section \ref{theoretical_framework}, we plotted estimates of $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ 
and $\rho_w$ on the same axes to
indicate how much of deer population synchrony can be attributed to MEI, and how that 
varies with timescale.
Given a timescale band, summing the values of our estimate of $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$ across frequencies
corresponding to timescales in the band, and also summing values of our estimate of $\rho_w(f)$ in the same way, and then taking the 
quotient, can be interpreted as the overall fraction of population synchrony in the 
band which was statistically attributable to $\epsilon^{(1)}$. We here describe the numerics of 
these procedures and methods we used to assess statistical significance of results. When our first specific model is 
applied to deer and MEI, and if results are revealed as significant by the below procedures, then the results constitute evidence that 
MEI is implicated in Moran effects generating synchrony in deer.

All spectral matrices, and quantities based on them, were estimated using the consistent estimator of @Brillinger2001 (section 7.4 of that text). 
To test statistical significance of $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ for the first specific model,
$1000$ Fourier surrogate datasets, $\delta_j^{(1)}$, $j=1,\ldots,1000$, were produced by randomizing
the phases of the univariate time series $\epsilon^{(1)}$.
Then $\rho_w^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$ was computed for each $j$, and $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ was compared to the
distribution of the quantities $\rho_w^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$. This tests to see whether the portion of population synchrony
explained by $\epsilon^{(1)}$ (i.e., $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$) was greater than the portion "explained"
by surrogate datasets which were in no way related to $w$, but which had the same temporal autocorrelation
properties as $\epsilon^{(1)}$. 

To get a single $p$-value associated with the comparison, across a whole timescale band,
of $\rho_{w}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ to the distribution of $\rho_{w}^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$, we
used two alternative methods. For the first method, we summed $\rho_{w}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ across
the band, and separately summed $\rho_{w}^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$ across the band for each surrogate, $j$.
The fraction of surrogate sums greater than the actual sum provided a $p$-value for the band. 

The second method was as follows. For each frequency $f$ in the band, we computed the rank of
$\rho_{w}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$ in the distribution $\rho_{w}^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}(f)$
($j=1,\ldots,1000$), and we averaged these ranks across frequencies,
$f$, in the band. The same procedure applied
to each surrogate separately (i.e., ranking $\rho_{w}^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}(f)$
against the $\rho_{w}^{(\delta_{j'}^{(1)})}(f)$ for all $j' \neq j$) produced
surrogate mean rank values for the band. The proportion of surrogate
mean ranks greater than the actual mean rank provided a $p$-value for the band.

\subsubsection{Numeric and significance procedures associated with the second specific model}\label{numerics_model2}

\noindent We applied the second specific model of the previous section to two cases: deer as $w$ and 
snow depth data as $\epsilon^{(1)}$; and DVCs as $w$ and deer data as $\epsilon^{(1)}$.
We here describe numeric methods associated with the applications of our mathematical results to these cases, 
as well as methods we used to assess statistical significance of results.
If results are revealed as significant by the below procedures, then the results constitute evidence that 
snow depth is implicated in Moran effects generating synchrony in deer, or that deer are implicated 
in generating synchrony in DVCs.

Estimation of the matrix $M=S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}} S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1} S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}^*$
for the second specific model when $\mathcal{A}$ is not a scalar filter triggers numeric difficulties.
If $N$ is large, then accurately
computing the inverse of the matrix $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}(f)$ can be
numerically intractable. It is well known that computing the actual inverse of a large matrix
is a numerically unstable procedure, and there are workarounds; in our case one can attempt to compute
$S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1} S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}^*$ directly, without computing
the inverse matrix $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1}$ itself, using procedures that are
somewhat more numerically stable. However, these procedures can still lead to numeric difficulties for
large $N$. This is all the more true because the $i$th row of $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}$
is of the form
\begin{equation}
R_i(f)=(S_{\epsilon^{(1)}_i \epsilon^{(1)}_1} (f),S_{\epsilon^{(1)}_i \epsilon^{(1)}_2} (f),\ldots,S_{\epsilon^{(1)}_i \epsilon^{(1)}_N} (f)).
\end{equation}
\noindent If $\epsilon^{(1)}$ is itself highly spatially synchronous, and especially
if the sampling locations corresponding to rows
$i_1$ and $i_2$ are close to each other geographically, then $\epsilon^{(1)}_{i_1}$ and $\epsilon^{(1)}_{i_2}$
will be similar processes. So the rows $R_{i_1}(f)$ and $R_{i_2}(f)$ will tend to be
similar, as vectors, tending to render $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}(f)$
closer to singular and $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}^{-1} S_{w \epsilon^{(1)}}^*$ harder
to compute. Larger values of $N$ tend to
compound this difficulty. Although we assumed that $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}(f)$
is not exactly singular, and an estimate of this matrix from data using standard spectral estimation
procedures should produce a nonsingular matrix with probability $1$, it is nevertheless true that
for any frequency, $f$, for large $N$, $S_{\epsilon^{(1)} \epsilon^{(1)}}(f)$ can often
be close enough to singular to render it difficult to work with.

We developed a workaround which we describe here. For our data, 
the numeric difficulties described above do not manifest when $N$ is small,
about $5$. Therefore we randomly partitioned the $N=60$ sampling locations into groups of $5$, for deer. This was
done once and for all, prior to the steps described below, to avoid multiple-testing-type
problems from trying multiple partitions. For DVCs, we partitioned the $N=71$ sampling locations into groups of $5$,
discarding one location. Denote the partitioning by $\Omega$ and the $i$th subset of sampling
locations of the partitioning by $\Omega_i$ ($i=1,\ldots,12$ for our deer data, $i=1,\ldots,14$ for DVCs).
For each $\Omega_i$, we then
computed $\rho_{w,\Omega_i}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$, the portion of population
synchrony in the populations sampled
at the locations in $\Omega_i$ which was statistically attributable to $\epsilon^{(1)}$. This was
averaged across the subsets $\Omega_i$ (let $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$ denote that average),
as was $\rho_{w,\Omega_i}(f)$, the total population synchrony for the locations in $\Omega_i$
(let $\rho_{w,\Omega}(f)$ denote that average). The two averages were then
compared. This comparison does not have strictly the same meaning as it would have to compare
the numerically intractable
quantity $\rho_{w}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$ to $\rho_{w}(f)$, if the first of these quantities were
computable; but it has a qualitatively similar meaning and can be interpreted in a similar way
as a portion of population synchrony explained by $\epsilon^{(1)}$. Although the subsets $\Omega_i$
consisted of only $5$ locations each, these locations were selected ramdomly, not by grouping nearby
sampling locations together. So the quantities $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$ and 
$\rho_{w,\Omega}(f)$ are not unduly focused on short-range synchrony.

Given data, we plotted estimates of $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ and 
$\rho_{w,\Omega}$ against frequency. Given a timescale band, we also summed the values of 
our estimate of $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$ across frequencies, $f$,
corresponding to timescales in the band, and summed values of our estimate of
$\rho_{w,\Omega}(f)$ in the same way. The first of these sums divided by the second was 
interpreted as providing information about the fraction of population synchrony in that timescale
band which was statistically attributable to $\epsilon^{(1)}$.  

To test statistical significance, 1000 synchrony preserving Fourier surrogate datasets,
$\delta_j^{(1)}$, $j=1,\ldots,1000$, were produced by randomizing the Fourier phases of the time series 
comprising $\epsilon^{(1)}$. For each frequency, the same phase shift was imposed on all time series, so synchrony
between sampling locations for a surrogate dataset was the same as that for the original data, though surrogates
were rendered unrelated to $w$.
Then $\rho_{w,\Omega_i}^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}(f)$ was computed for each $i$ and $j$, the average
$\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}(f)$ across the subsets $\Omega_i$ was produced for each
surrogate, $j$, and the quantity $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$ was compared to the
surrogate-based quantities $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}(f)$. This tests to see whether
the portion of synchrony explained by $\epsilon^{(1)}$ (i.e., $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$)
was greater than the portion "explained" by surrogate datasets which were in no way related to
$w$, but which had the same spatial and temporal autocorrelation properties as $\epsilon^{(1)}$.

To get a single $p$-value associated with the comparison, across a whole timescale band,
of $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ to the distribution of $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$, we
used two alternative methods. For the first method, we summed $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$
across the band, and separately summed $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$ across the band for each
surrogate, $j$. The fraction of surrogate sums greater than the actual sum provided a $p$-value 
for the band.

The second methods was as follows. For each frequency $f$ in the band, we computed the rank of
$\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}(f)$ in the distribution $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}(f)$
($j=1,\ldots,1000$), and we averaged these ranks across frequencies,
$f$, in the band. The same procedure applied
to each surrogate separately (i.e., ranking $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}(f)$
against the $\rho_{w,\Omega}^{(\delta_{j'}^{(1)})}(f)$ for all $j' \neq j$) produced
surrogate mean rank values for the band. The proportion of surrogate
mean ranks less than the actual mean rank provided a $p$-value for the band.

\subsection{How to show that cycles are due to timescale-specific synchrony}\label{sect:FourierCycles}

\noindent After discovering (Fig. \ref{MT-Fig3_DeerSync}A, \ref{ComprehensiveFourier_SynchronyIsTimescaleSpecific_phase}A,
\ref{ComprehensiveFourier_SynchronyIsTimescaleSpecific_permute}A) that synchrony in deer is primarily at $3-7$-year timescales, to 
test whether this synchrony caused cycles in state-level deer time series and therefore whether
our theory (main text and SI section \ref{SI:theory}) is reflected in deer data, 
we tested whether spectral power in the $3-7$-year timescale band was much greater for the total deer time series 
for WI than it would have been without synchrony between county-level deer time series in the $3-7$-year 
band. In other words, if synchrony in the $3-7$-year band were a cause of $3-7$-year deer population 
cycling at the state level, as predicted by the theory, then when synchrony is removed but county-level time series are 
kept otherwise statistically similar, state-level cycling should be significantly and substantially reduced. 
We calculated spectral power in the $3-7$-year band and compared the result to the same statistic calculated 
for the surrogate time series of Fig. \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations}A (grey lines - methods for 
generating those surrogates are described in SI section \ref{SI:methods}). A $p$-value result for the test of the null hypothesis that
synchrony did not cause or amplify cycling is the fraction of surrogate values greater than the 
value for data. We also displayed the power spectra of the data and the surrogates to visually show 
whether the spectrum of data was above the distribution of spectra for surrogates for each 
timescale/frequency in the $3-7$-year band. To calculate spectral power in the $3-7$-year band we summed a raw 
periodogram across those timescales; to display the spectrum
we used a consistent estimator of @Brillinger2001 (section 5.6 of that text). The summed
periodogram provides the exact spectral power in the band, whereas the consistent estimator is
smoothed and is more appropriate for display of the spectrum [@Brillinger2001].

<!--To ensure our results are not Type I error, we applied Bonferroni-corrections to our p-values. Whether this is appropriate is is debatable, since our theory and our deer wavelet mean fields, which showed synchrony in the $3-7$-year timescale range,
provided an \emph{a priori} reason to test the $3-7$-year timescale range, specifically, rather than scanning across multiple 
timescales bands for a spectral peak. Nevertheless, we conducted this extra test to be extra conservative. Power spectra based on 36-year time series, such as those we used, are typically evaluated at 
18 frequencies, and there are 7 such frequencies corresponding to timescales between 3 and 7 years, the ratio being
18/7=2.57. Rounding up to 3 tests, a Bonferroni-adjusted $p$-value threshold for a 
family-wise error rate of $5\%$ may therefore be considered to be 
$0.05/3=0.0166$, -->

Our theory predicts that timescale-specific synchrony such as we have described should cause cycling in the 
spatial-total population, so one prediction of the theory is simply that the state-total deer population in WI should
show a spectral peak at $3-7$-year timescales, corresponding to cycles. Autoregressive 
surrogates are fairly common and have been used for significance testing
spectral quantities; and AR(1) models have no spectral peak, so they have been used to test
for the significance of spectral peaks. Therefore, we also tested whether the spectral peak in 
the state-total deer time series was significant compared to AR(1) surrogates. We emphasize, however,
that we consider a comparison to autoregressive surrogates less appropriate for our research goals, here, 
than the approach of the previous paragraph, because AR(1) surrogates do not correspond to a null hypothesis that 
is explicitly about synchrony. Nevertheless, we proceeded with an alternative analysis using AR(1) surrogates, 
for completeness. We fitted an AR(1)
model by maximum likelihood to the detrended state-total deer time series, and then
used the resulting parameterized model to generate surrogate timeseries. Spectral power in the 
$3-7$-year band (computed by summing a raw periodogram across the band) for data was compared
to the distribution of values of the same statistic for surrogates, again producing a $p$-value.
We also displayed the power spectra (using the estimator of section 5.6 of @Brillinger2001) of 
the data and the surrogates, again to make possible visual comparison for individual 
timescales/frequencies. 
<!--For this analysi, we considered two multiple-testing corrections, both very conservative but one even more so than the other.
First, we considered timescales to correspond to independent tests (though they do not, for the spectral estimator we used, which 
involves smoothing the raw periodigram across nearby frequencies), and equating the number of timescales within the $3-7$-year band to the number of tests performed. This would result in a Bonferroni-corrected threshold for a family-wise error rate of $0.05$ 
to be $0.05/7=0.0071$. Second, using the same approach but for all 18 timescales
for which spectra were available, the Bonferroni-corrected threshold was $0.05/18=0.0027$. -->

To provide additional evidence that state-total deer populations in WI were indeed cyclic, 
with periodicity in the $3-7$-year range, we used maximum likelihood to fit autoregressive models of different orders to 
detrended state-total deer time series, comparing orders using the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC); and we also displayed the detrended state-total time series for examination of whether the
periodicity is visually apparent. Recall that lower AIC values indicate better model-data correspondence. 
Spectra were displayed for the fitted models of orders for which the
AIC indicated the best correspondence with data. If these spectra were peaked, and spectra of
higher-AIC models were not (AR(0) and AR(1) models have non-peaked spectra), this supports
peakedness of spectra against a non-peaked alternative. 

If our theory is reflected in deer data, then periodicity at $3-7$-year timescales should be 
not only statistically meaningful, as will be demonstrated with the methods described above, 
but should also be stronger 
for the state-total deer time series than it is for the county-level deer time series. So we tested this hypothesis. 
We first detrended both the state-total and county deer time series and standardized the variance of each of these time series. 
We then computed total spectral power in the $3-7$-year timescale band for all these time series
and compared the state- and county-level results. Variance standardization was used prior
to computing spectral power because we 
were not interested in whether the state or county level time series had higher spectral power 
- the state-level time series was expected to have higher power because state-total time series represented 
more deer, and hence was, *a priori*,
likely to be more variable in all timescale bands. Instead we were interested in whether a greater
proportion of time series variance was concentrated in the $3-7$-year band for the state-total time series
than for the county-level time series (i.e., if the state-level spectrum was more peaked
within the $3-7$-year band than were the county-level spectra), which is what our post-standardization 
analysis tests for.  

Finally, if our theory is reflected in deer data, then the decomposition of $S_{\text{tot}}$ into spectral and cospectral 
contribitions (equation (\ref{MT-mainresmt}) of the main text, Theorem \ref{prop:mainthm} of SI section \ref{SI:theory}) 
should reveal much greater cospectral contributions to the peak of $S_{\text{tot}}$ on $3-7$-year timescales. We tested this.
Another formulation of equation (\ref{MT-mainresmt}) is 
\begin{equation}
S_{\text{tot}}=\sum_{i,j} C_{w_i w_j} = \sum_i C_{w_i w_i} + \sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j},
\end{equation}
\noindent which also follows straightforwardly from the definitions of the spectra and cospectra of the population processes $w_i$ 
and the spectrum, $S_{\text{tot}}$, of $w_{\text{tot}}=\sum_i w_i$. Note that the second term in the above decomposition, 
$\sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j}$, equals $\rho_w$. We computed estimates of $\sum_i C_{w_i w_i}$ and 
$\sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j}$, as well as their sum $S_{\text{tot}}=\sum_{i,j} C_{w_i w_j}$, and displayed them 
all on the same axes, for the purpose of comparing the relative contributions of $\sum_i C_{w_i w_i}$ and 
$\sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j}$. The consistent estimator of @Brillinger2001 (section 7.4 of that text) was used. 
We also computed these same quantities for surrogate datasets that had been independently phase-randomized at
all frequencies, and at frequencies in the $3-7$-year timescale range, in separate computations. These randomizations
do not influence $\sum_i C_{w_i w_i}$, but they do reduce $\sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j}$ to zero, up to sampling variation.
If theory was manifest in data, we should have $\sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j} \gg \sum_i C_{w_i w_i}$, and 
$\sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j}$ should also be highly significant in comparison to its value for the surrogates.

For DVCs, we tested whether spectral power in the $3-7$-year timescale band was much greater for the total DVC time series 
for WI than it would have been without synchrony between county-level DVC time series in the $3-7$-year 
band, using the same methods employed for deer (Fig.  \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations}C surrogates). We also visually compared spectra of 
the state-total DVC time series and the surrogates of Fig.  \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations}C. AR(1)
surrogates were not appropriate for significance testing the contribution of synchrony to $3-7$-year periodicity in
the state-total DVC time series, because the state-total DVC time series had substantial low-frequency power (Fig.  \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations}C),
and that power would inappropriately influence the fitted AR(1). Although there may be a modified approch, 
because AR(1) surrogates were considered less appropriate anyway for our research questions, further efforts to 
use AR(1) surrogates with DVC time series were not undertaken. Comparisons, via AIC, of the fits of AR models of different orders were 
also considered inappropriate for DVCs for similar reasons. Finally, comparison of variance-standardized 
state- and county-level time series was not appropriate for DVCs because the variance standardization 
means that $3-7$-year spectral power is also influenced by the amount of low-frequency power. We did, however, produce a 
decomposition of $S_{\text{tot}}$ for DVCs analogous to that performed for deer (see previous paragraph).


# Alternative analyses: results \label{sect:alt_results}

\subsection{Patterns of synchrony in deer and DVCs are timescale specific}\label{sect:FourierTSSync_res}

Fourier results summarized in this section corroborate our conclusions based on wavelet analyses 
(Figs \ref{MT-Fig3_DeerSync}, \ref{MT-Fig4_DvcSync}, \ref{FigS7_WMFAndPredictionsDistricts}) that 
synchrony in both deer and DVCs was timescale specific, occurring principally on $3-7$-year timescales.

Plots of $\rho_w(f)$ were clearly peaked in the $3-7$-year timescale range for both deer and DVCs. Synchrony was revealed by these plots
to be highly statistically significant in comparison to independently 
phase-randomized surrogates (Fig. \ref{ComprehensiveFourier_SynchronyIsTimescaleSpecific_phase}).
See SI section \ref{sect:FourierTSSync} for details on these phase-randomized surrogates.

For deer, comparison of $\rho_w(f)$ to values of the same statistic for random-permutation surrogates 
(see SI section \ref{sect:FourierTSSync} for details on random-permutation surrogates) revealed that the peak
in the $3-7$-year timescale range was much higher than could reasonably have occurred if synchrony were evenly distributed across
timescales (Fig. \ref{ComprehensiveFourier_SynchronyIsTimescaleSpecific_permute}A). This demonstrates that deer
synchrony was timescale specific, with a preponderance of the synchrony occurring in the $3-7$-year range. 
Our "peakiness" statistic (SI section \ref{sect:FourierTSSync}) took a larger value for deer data than it did for
a fraction $`r round(1-pval_deer_peakiness,4)`$ of the random-permutation surrogates we used. The frequencies 
$f_1$, $f_2$ and $f_3$ we used for the peakiness statistic, measured in cycles per time step (see SI section \ref{sect:FourierTSSync}), 
were $f_1 \approx 0.111$, $f_2 \approx 0.194$ and $f_3 \approx 0.278$. Thus the null 
hypothesis was firmly rejected that $\rho_w(f)$ was no more peaked in the $3-7$-year timescale 
range than could have been expected by chance if synchrony 
were evenly distributed across timescales ($p = `r round(pval_deer_peakiness,4)`$, based on $10000$ surrogates). 

For DVCs,
although parts of $\rho_w(f)$ exceeded the $97.5$th quantile for random-perturbation surrogates and parts went below
the $2.5$th quantile (Fig. \ref{ComprehensiveFourier_SynchronyIsTimescaleSpecific_permute}), and this 
demonstrated that synchrony was timescale-specific for DVCs, $\rho_w(f)$ was between 
these surrogate quantiles for the $3-7$-year timescale range. But this
was only because DVC synchrony was very high for long timescales (low frequencies) and very low for short timescales (high 
frequencies). Our "peakiness" statistic (SI section \ref{sect:FourierTSSync}) took a larger value for DVC data than it did for a fraction
$`r round(1-pval_dvcs_peakiness,4)`$ of random-permutation surrogates, demonstrating that the peak in 
$\rho_w(f)$ in the $3-7$-year timescale range was a meaningful spectral feature 
($p = `r round(pval_dvcs_peakiness,4)`$, based on $10000$ surrogates). We here 
used $f_1 \approx 0.167$, $f_2 \approx 0.233$ and $f_3 \approx 0.333$ (see SI section \ref{sect:FourierTSSync}) 
for the peakiness statistic. 

\subsection{Synchrony is due to timescale-specific Moran effects}\label{sect:FourierMoran_res}

Fourier results summarized in this section corroborate our conclusions based on wavelet analyses 
(Tables \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary},
\ref{TabS2_SummaryDistrict}, Figs \ref{FigS4_PhaseDiffs}, \ref{FigS5_RanksInSurrogs}) that 
timescale-specific patterns of deer and DVC synchrony are due to timescale-specific Moran effects. We first
provide additional evidence that it is reasonable to apply our modelling framework (SI section \ref{theoretical_framework})
to deer, snow depth, and MEI, and to DVCs and deer (SI section \ref{Crosscorr_and_regression}); then we summarize results of applying the
framework to deer and MEI (SI section \ref{Deer_MEI_FMT_results}), to deer and snow depth (SI section \ref{Deer_snow_FMT_results}), and to DVCs and deer
(SI section \ref{DVC_deer_FMT_results}). Results agreed in every case with our wavelet results.

\subsubsection{Cross correlation and regression analyses}\label{Crosscorr_and_regression}

\noindent To further support the reasoning of SI section \ref{suitable_framework} that our first and
second specific models were adequately suited to our data, we carried out the elementary regression and 
correlation analyses described in that section. 

Using pre-treated data (detrended, normalized, standardized variance), we computed the mean
(across locations) correlation between deer and snow depth time series, and compared that value
to the distribution of the same statistic computed using $10000$ surrogate snow depth datasets. Surrogates
were created by randomizing the Fourier phases of the original snow depth time series, but using
the same randomizations in all locations, so a surrogate snow depth dataset had the same spatial
and temporal autocorrelation properties as the original snow depth data. Only a fraction `r round(cor_pvals_deer_snow["p_onetailed_stat1"],4)`
of surrogate values were greater than the value for the original data, indicating that deer and
snow depth time series were more correlated than expected by chance. 

We also examined lagged correlations 
between deer and snow depth, because wavelet analyses suggested a lagged or phase-shifted relationship
between these variables (Table \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Fig. \ref{FigS4_PhaseDiffs}). 
We computed the average, across locations, of lag-1 correlations between deer and
snow depth time series, and the same for lag 2. We averaged these two quantities to form a statistic. 
We used lags of 1 and 2 because these are the lags suggested by the phase relationships detected in 
wavelet analyses between deer and snow depth time series on $3-4$-year timescales, where wavelet results
showed the strongest relationship between deer and snow depth (Table \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary}).
The same statistic was also computed using $10000$ surrogate snow depth datasets. Only a fraction
`r round(cor_pvals_deer_snow["p_onetailed_stat4"],4)` of surrogate values were greater than the value for the 
original data, again indicating a relationship between deer and snow depth, and supporting the reasonableness of 
modelling deer in terms of snow depth. 

We repeated the same two analyses of deer and snow depth data, but this time using data which were pre-filtered to
remove all variation outside the $3-4$-year range. Both deer and snow depth time series were 
filtered by removing Fourier components outside that timescale range. This was done because the 
relationship between deer and snow depth revealed by wavelet 
analyses were primarily on $3-4$-year timescales (Table \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Fig. \ref{FigS5_RanksInSurrogs}), 
so correlations between these variables should be present when only
the variation on those timescales was present. The $p$-value result based on using the un-lagged correlation
statistic described above was `r round(cor_pvals_deer_snow["p_onetailed_stat1_filt"],4)`, and the result using the
lagged statistic was `r round(cor_pvals_deer_snow["p_onetailed_stat4_filt"],4)`.

We also carried out similar analyses for deer and MEI, though we did not do an unlagged correlation analysis
for these variables because wavelet analyses indicated a quarter-phase relationship between deer and MEI
(Table \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Fig. \ref{FigS4_PhaseDiffs}), 
and quarter-phase relationships are associated with correlations of zero. We averaged lagged correlations between 
deer and MEI across lags 1, 2 and 3, and across locations. We used lags 1, 2 and 3 
because these were the closest lags corresponging to the
phase relationship between these variables that was indicated by the wavelet analyses.
The approach was the same as above of comparing the value of a statistic computed for data to a distribution of
values of the same statistic computed for surrogates. A $p$-value of `r round(cor_pvals_deer_mei["p_onetailed_stat4"],4)`
was obtained, and a $p$-value of `r round(cor_pvals_deer_mei["p_onetailed_stat4_filt"],4)` for a parallel analysis using 
data which was pre-filtered to remove all variation outside the $4-7$-year timescale range. This was
the range where wavelet analyses revealed the strongest relationship between deer and MEI
(Table \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Fig. \ref{FigS5_RanksInSurrogs}).
These results again supported as reasonable our decision to model deer in terms of MEI. 

We did a simple, unlagged correlation analysis of the relationship between deer and DVCs. 
We computed the mean (across locations) correlation between deer and DVC time series, and compared that value
to values of the same statistic computed using surrogates. We did not carry out lagged correlation analyses because wavelet
analyses indicated an in-phase relationship between deer and DVCs
(Table \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, Fig. \ref{FigS4_PhaseDiffs}).
The $p$-value result was `r round(cor_pvals_dvcs_deer["p_onetailed_stat1"],4)` (this and all $p$-values obtained from 
randomization-based approaches should be understood to be accurate within the precision available from the number of 
surrogate datasets used, in this case $10000$), and the $p$-value result of the
parallel analysis using data pre-filtered to the $3-7$-year timescale range was `r round(cor_pvals_dvcs_deer["p_onetailed_stat1_filt"],4)`.
These results again supported as reasonable our modelling framework.

Finally, we regressed deer in year $t$ against deer in years $t-1$, $t-2$ and $t-3$, and against snow depth in years
$t$ back to $t-3$, and against MEI in years $t$ back to $t-3$. The regression model treated all locations in the 
same way, consistent with the spatial homogeneity assumptions of our first and second specific models (SI section \ref{theoretical_framework}). 
The lags $0$ to $3$ were chosen arbitrarily since, as explained in SI section \ref{suitable_framework}, there is no need to 
determine the optimal lags nor the optimal model parameter values. Instead, our goals were simply to demonstrate that the influence
of snow depth and MEI on deer is apparent in our data, to show that our modelling framework is reasonable, and to 
check the assumption that the complex roots of the polynomial $1-b_1 z - \cdots - b_n z^n$ had modulus greater than 1.
The regression model explained a fraction `r round(summary(lmres_deer_vs_lags)$adj.r.squared,4)` of the variation
in the response variable. Using the regression model to get $b_1$, $b_2$ and $b_3$, the complex roots of
$1-b_1 z - b_2 z^2 - b_3 z^3$ all had modulus greater than $1$.

\subsubsection{Deer and MEI}\label{Deer_MEI_FMT_results}

\noindent The plot of $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ and $\rho_w$ on the same axes (SI section \ref{numerics_model1})
revealed that MEI explained a substantial portion of the synchrony in deer in parts of the $3-7$-year range
(SI Fig. \ref{Fourier_Step2_deermei_results}).
The plot of $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ was in the upper part of the distribution of the surrogate quantities
$\rho_w^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$, especially in the $4-7$-year range, visually suggesting that MEI statistically explained
a significant portion of deer synchrony. The $p$-value results of comparing $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$
to the distribution of $\rho_w^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$ in an aggregate fashion across the timescale ranges
$3-7$ years, $3-4$ years, and $4-7$ years, using the first method described in SI section \ref{numerics_model1},
were `r round(pvalresFMTalt_mei_3to7,4)`, `r round(pvalresFMTalt_mei_3to4,4)` and `r round(pvalresFMTalt_mei_4to7,4)`, 
respectively. The results using the second method described in SI section \ref{numerics_model1} (the rank of ranks method)
were `r round(pvalresFMT_mei_3to7,4)`, `r round(pvalresFMT_mei_3to4,4)` and `r round(pvalresFMT_mei_4to7,4)`, 
respectively. Thus statistical results confirmed the visual indication provided by SI Fig. 
\ref{Fourier_Step2_deermei_results} that MEI can statistically explain a significant portion of deer synchrony in
the $4-7$-year and $3-7$-year ranges, but not in the $3-4$-year range. These results are consistent with our wavelet
results (Table \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, \ref{FigS5_RanksInSurrogs}), both in the general result 
that MEI can explain deer synchrony across the $3-7$-year timescale range, and in 
the specific result that MEI is a better explainer of deer synchrony in the $4-7$-year sub-range than it is in the
$3-4$-year sub-range.

\subsubsection{Deer and snow depth}\label{Deer_snow_FMT_results}

\noindent The plot of $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ and $\rho_w$ on the same axes (SI section \ref{numerics_model2})
revealed that snow depth also explained a substantial portion of the synchrony in deer in parts of the $3-7$-year range
(SI Fig. \ref{Fourier_Step2_deersnow_results}).
The plot of $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ was in the upper part of the distribution of the surrogate quantities
$\rho_w^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$, especially in the $3-4$-year range, visually suggesting that snow depth statistically explained
a significant portion of deer synchrony. The $p$-value results of comparing $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$
to the distribution of $\rho_w^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$ in an aggregate fashion across the timescale ranges
$3-7$ years, $3-4$ years, and $4-7$ years, using the first method described in SI section \ref{numerics_model2},
were `r round(pvalresFMTalt_snow_3to7,4)`, `r round(pvalresFMTalt_snow_3to4,4)` and `r round(pvalresFMTalt_snow_4to7,4)`, 
respectively. The results using the second method described in SI section \ref{numerics_model2} (the rank of ranks method)
were `r round(pvalresFMT_snow_3to7,4)`, `r round(pvalresFMT_snow_3to4,4)` and `r round(pvalresFMT_snow_4to7,4)`, 
respectively. Thus statistical results confirmed the visual indication provided by SI Fig. 
\ref{Fourier_Step2_deersnow_results} that snow depth can statistically explain a significant portion of deer synchrony in
the $3-4$-year and $3-7$-year ranges, and also in the $4-7$-year range, though the effect seems slightly weaker in that latter range. 
These results are consistent with our wavelet
results (Table \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, \ref{FigS5_RanksInSurrogs}), both in the general result that snow 
depth can explain deer synchrony across the $3-7$-year timescale range, and in 
the specific result that snow depth appears to be a better explainer of deer synchrony in the $3-4$-year sub-range than it is in the
$4-7$-year sub-range.

\subsubsection{DVCs and deer}\label{DVC_deer_FMT_results}

\noindent The plot of $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ and $\rho_w$ on the same axes (SI section \ref{numerics_model2})
revealed that deer explained a substantial portion of the synchrony in DVCs in the $3-7$-year range
(SI Fig. \ref{Fourier_Step2_dvcdeer_results}).
The plot of $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$ was in the upper part of the distribution of the surrogate quantities
$\rho_w^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$ for many frequencies in the $3-7$-year timescale range. 
The $p$-value result of comparing $\rho_w^{(\epsilon^{(1)})}$
to the distribution of $\rho_w^{(\delta_j^{(1)})}$ in an aggregate fashion across the $3-7$-year timescale range, 
using the first method described in SI section \ref{numerics_model2},
was `r round(pvalresFMTalt_dvcs_by_deer_3to7,4)`. The result using the second method described in SI 
section \ref{numerics_model2} (the rank of ranks method)
was `r round(pvalresFMT_dvcs_by_deer_3to7,4)`. Thus statistical results confirmed the visual indication provided by SI Fig. 
\ref{Fourier_Step2_dvcdeer_results} that deer can statistically explain a significant portion of DVC synchrony in
the $3-7$-year timescale range. These results are consistent with our wavelet
results (Table \ref{MT-Tab1_CountyCoherenceSummary}, \ref{FigS5_RanksInSurrogs}).

\subsection{Cycles are due to timescale-specific synchrony}\label{sect:FourierCycles_res}

\noindent Fourier results summarized in this section corroborate our conclusions based on wavelet analyses 
(Fig. \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations}) that state-level cycles in deer and DVCs were a result of timescale-specific synchrony.

Total spectral power in the $3-7$-year timescale band for detrended state-total
deer time series (see SI section \ref{sect:FourierCycles} for methods) was much greater than the same quantity
computed for the surrogates of Fig. \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations}; this was true for
all the surrogates used (Fig. \ref{FigS_SpectPow3to7Fig5Surrogs}). Since the surrogates represent a case 
in which synchrony in the $3-7$-year timescale band is absent but county-level deer time series are 
kept otherwise statistically similar, this result shows that synchrony in the $3-7$-year timescale band
markedly increases state-total population cycling on $3-7$-year timescales. The corresponding $p$-value
(SI section \ref{sect:FourierCycles}) would be vanishingly small. The power spectrum of the state-total
deer time series was above the spectra of all surrogates at nearly all frequencies corresponding
to timescales in the $3-7$-year range (Fig. \ref{FigS_SpectraFig5Surrogs}).

Total spectral power in the $3-7$-year timescale band for detrended state-total
deer time series was also greater than the same quantity computed for all but a fraction `r round(Fourier3PvalRes,4)` 
of AR(1) surrogates (Fig. \ref{FigS_SpectPow3to7ARSurrogs}). Thus `r round(Fourier3PvalRes,4)` is a $p$-value for a test of the 
null hypothesis corresponding to AR(1) surrogates. However, we emphasize, as explained in SI section \ref{sect:FourierCycles},
that that null hypothesis does not explicitly relate to synchrony, and so is less appropriate for our research purposes
then the null hypothesis represented by the surrogates of Fig. \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations}, for which the $p$-value was
vanishingly small, much lower than `r round(Fourier3PvalRes,4)` (see previous paragraph and 
Fig. \ref{FigS_SpectPow3to7Fig5Surrogs}). We nevertheless provide the 
AR analyses to demonstrate the robustness of our conclusions.
<!--Because the tests in the two preceding
paragraphs focused on timescales in the $3-7$-year range, but spectra were generated for timescales across a broader range, we applied Bonferroni-corrections to our results, with the Bonferroni-adjusted $p$-value threshold for a 
family-wise error rate of $5\%$ to be 
$0.05/3=0.0166$. Based on this value, both tests in the preceding two paragraphs were still significant after a   
conservative correction. -->
The power spectrum of the state-total deer time series was also compared visually to the spectra of AR(1) surrogates
(Fig. \ref{FigS_SpectraARSurrogs}). For several timescales within the $3-7$-year range the data spectrum was higher than the
95th quantile of surrogate spectra. 
<!--Our two Bonferroni-corrected thresholds for a family-wise error rate of $0.05$ 
to be $0.05/7=0.0071$ for the $3-7$-year band and $0.05/18=0.0027$ for all 18 timescales
for which spectra were available. The spectrum of data exceeded
the former and almost exceeded the latter threshold for at least one timescale in the $3-7$-year range (Fig. 
\ref{FigS_SpectraARSurrogs}). We emphasize that these tests are excessively conservative and sub-optimal for multiple 
reasons: 1) they use AR(1) surrogates, which are not ideal, as discussed above; 2) they require that the spectrum of data 
exceed spectra of surrogates for at least one *specific timescale* in the range $3-7$-year, whereas theory and results on 
synchrony only predict that *total spectral power* in that range will exceed that of appropriate surrogates; 3) they assume 
independence of timescales, and the latter test sub-optimally counts timescales outside the $3-7$-year range as tests performed, 
even though theory and wavelet mean field results provide an *a prior* reason to examine only timescales within the
$3-7$-year range; 4) the Bonferroni correction is well known to be a conservative multiple-testing correction. 
Although the results at the beginning of this section (Fig. \ref{FigS_SpectPow3to7Fig5Surrogs} and accompanying results 
on total spectral power in the $3-7$-year range) are more appropriate and also indicate substantially higher 
statistical confidence that our deer provide evidence of our theoretical mechanism, we nevertheless provide these 
alternative analyses to demonstrate the robustness of our conclusions: for deer in WI, timescale-sepcific synchrony 
promotes significant population cycling even under extremely conservative statistical testing procedures.--> 

Fitting AR models of different orders to the detrended state-total deer time series gave AIC values
as in Table \ref{Table_AR_AIC_Table}. Second-order (AR(2)) models resulted in the lowest AIC.
Order 3 had a similar AIC, but other orders had meaningfully worse AICs. Recall that lower AICs mean 
better model-data agreement, and AIC differences of more than 2 are considered meaningful.
We plotted the spectrum of the best-fitting AR(2) and AR(3) models (Fig. \ref{FigS_SpectraARFits}). 
These spectra were indistinguishable and they had a peak at frequency about 0.2 (timescale of 5 years). 
Non-peaked spectra, corresponding to the alternative hypothesis that the state-total deer time 
series is not significantly periodic, are represented by the AR(0) and AR(1) models, which have difinitively worse
AIC values (Table \ref{Table_AR_AIC_Table}). Fig. \ref{FigS_DetrendedStateTotalDeer} shows the detrended state-total
deer population time series. Periodicity seems visually evident, consistent with the several analyses presented above.

After detrending and standardizing variance, we tested whether spectral power in the $3-7$-year band 
was greater in the state-total deer population time series than in county-level time series
(see SI section \ref{sect:FourierCycles} for methods). This was a test of whether periodicity on these
timescales was greater at the state level, as predicted by theory, than it was at the county level.
Spectral power in the $3-7$-year band was greater for the state total than it was for every one of the
counties (Fig. \ref{FigS_StateVCounty}).

The decomposition of $S_{\text{tot}}$ into its components $\sum_i C_{w_i w_i}$ and $\rho_w=\sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j}$
(see SI section \ref{sect:FourierCycles}) for deer revealed that synchrony, $\rho_w$, contributed much more to 
$S_{\text{tot}}$ than did spectral power, $\sum_i C_{w_i w_i}$, of the individual deer time series
(Fig. \ref{Fig:StructureDecomp_deer}), consistent with our theory. As may have been expected from earlier results
on $\rho_w$, $\sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j}$ was highly significant compared to phase randomized surrogates (Fig. \ref{Fig:StructureDecomp_deer}).

<!--For DVCs, we tested whether spectral power in the $3-7$-year timescale band was much greater for the total DVC time series 
for WI than it would have been without synchrony between county-level DVC time series in the $3-7$-year 
band, using the same methods employed for deer (Fig.  \ref{MT-Fig3_DeerSync}C surrogates). We also visually compared spectra of 
the state-total DVC time series and the surrogates of Fig.  \ref{MT-Fig3_DeerSync}C. AR(1)
surrogates were not considered optimal even for the state-total deer time series (see above text).
However, they are wholly inappropriate for significance testing the contribution of synchrony to $3-7$-year periodicity in
the state-total DVC time series, because the state-total DVC time series had substantial low-frequency power (Fig.  \ref{MT-Fig3_DeerSync}C),
and that power would inappropriately influence the fitted AR(1) model which would have been used for surrogates. Although there may be a cubic
detrending or other approch that may have helped to address this mismatch, because our above tests for DVCs were anyway already 
regarded as superior tests of our research hypotheses, further efforts to use AR(1) surrogates in 
connection with DVC time series were not undertaken. Comparisons, via AIC, of the fits of AR models of different orders were 
also considered inappropriate for similar reasons. Finally, comparison of variance-standardized 
state- and county-level time series was not appropriate for DVCs because the variance standardization 
means that $3-7$-year spectral power is also influenced by the amount of low-frequency power, which is of 
no interest for our research question. Again, ammendments to the comparisons and tests made for deer
may have rendered such comparisons appropriate for application to DVCs, such ammendments appear 
*ad hoc*, and also unnecessary given the analysis described at the start of this paragraph, and its analogue 
for deer, were considered the appropriate analyses for our goals. -->
Spectral power in the $3-7$-year band was much greater for the state-total DVC time series than it was
for all of the surrogate time series of Fig.  \ref{MT-Fig5_StateWideFluctuations}C, indicating that synchrony in the $3-7$-year 
timescale band markedly increases state-total DVC cycling (Fig. \ref{FigS_DVCSpectPow3to7Fig5Surrogs}).
The power spectrum of the state-total
DVC time series was above the spectra of all surrogates at all frequencies corresponding
to timescales in the $3-7$-year range (Fig. \ref{FigS_DVCSpectraFig5Surrogs}).
As was the case for deer, the decomposition of $S_{\text{tot}}$ into its components $\sum_i C_{w_i w_i}$ and $\rho_w=\sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j}$
for DVCs revealed that synchrony, $\rho_w$, contributed much more to 
$S_{\text{tot}}$ than did spectral power, $\sum_i C_{w_i w_i}$, of the individual DVC time series
(Fig. \ref{Fig:StructureDecomp_DVCs}), consistent with our theory. Again consistent with earlier results, synchrony,
$\rho_w=\sum_{i \neq j} C_{w_i w_j}$, was highly significant compared to phase randomized surrogates (Fig. \ref{Fig:StructureDecomp_DVCs}).

Overall, Fourier results consistently agreed with wavelet results and supported the conclusions that:
1) synchrony in deer and DVCs was timescale specific and had a peak at $3-7$-year timescales;
2) synchrony was due to environmental Moran effects (deer) or Moran effects of deer (DVCs); and
3) statewide cycles in deer and DVCs occurred and can be largely attributed to the timescale-specific synchrony.

\caption[Demonstration of the wavelet mean field]{Detecting time- and timescale-specific
synchrony with the wavelet mean field. This figure was taken without change from
Sheppard \emph{et al.} (2016). Additional details can be found there and in SI section \ref{SI:methods}. 
Panels a-d show the principle of how synchrony
can differ for different timescales of dynamics. Time series y1 and y2 (a)
are exactly anti-correlated (out of phase), as are y3 and y4 (b). Combining
y1 with y3 and y1 with y4
gives two time series (c) which are synchronized on long timescales, but anti-synchronized
on short timescales. The reverse is also possible (d). This timescale-specific
structure of synchrony cannot be detected with correlation coefficients, which are
0 for both c and d, because contributions from different timescales cancel.
In practice, real population and environmental signals are broadband, and exact cancellation
is unlikely, but asynchrony at some frequencies can strongly conceal important
synchrony at other frequencies. Panels e-k demonstrate this concealment, using artificial data,
and also show how the wavelet mean field magnitude detects time- and timescale-specific synchrony.
Each of 11 artificial time series were constructed as the sum of: 1) a single common
signal of amplitude 1 that changes its oscillatory period at $t=50$ from 10 years
to 5 years (e); 2) oscillations
of amplitude 3 that have the same oscillatory period
(3 years), but random and independent phases in
each of the 11 constructed
time series (f); and 3) white noise of standard deviation 1.5, again independently
generated for each of the 11 time series (g). Synchrony in the resulting time series cannot
be visually detected (i), nor is it readily apparent by examining the
55 pairwise correlation coefficients between time series (j), which spanned a
wide range of values including 0. But the wavelet mean field magnitude (k)
showed clear color bands at 10-year period for $t<50$ and 5-year period for
$t>50$. The wavelet mean field magnitude displays strength of
synchrony as a function of timescale
of dynamics and time, here with red indicating synchrony and blue asynchrony.
Wavelet phasor mean field magnitude plots are similar to (k), but with values
between 0 and 1 that indicate the strength of phase synchrony. These values can be
straightforwardly significance tested as described in SI section \ref{SI:methods}, and
by Sheppard \emph{et al.} (2019). \label{PedagogFigWMF}}

\caption[Demonstration of spatial wavelet coherence]{Measuring relationships between variables using spatial wavelet coherence.
This figure was adapted with only minor changes
from supplementary figure 5 of Sheppard \emph{et al.} (2016).
The time series of panel e were used as drivers in producing the time series of
panel f and the figure shows
how this relationship can be detected with the spatial wavelet coherence technique.
The time series of panel e
were constructed as the sum of: 1) a single common signal of amplitude $1$ and
period $12$ years (a); 2) a
single common signal of amplitude $5$ and period $2$ years (b); and 3)
normally distributed white noise of standard deviation $1.5$,
independently generated for each of the $10$ time series (c). The time series
of panel f were produced via the
relationship $y_n(t) = (x_n(t)+x_n(t-1))/2 + \epsilon_n (t)$ where
the $\epsilon_n (t)$ were independent normal random numbers
of mean $0$ and standard deviation $3$. This transmits the period-$12$
component of the $x$ signals to the $y$ but
not the period-$2$ component because averaging covers a whole
period for that component. Correlations (f,
green numbers) between $x_n(t)$ and $y_n(t)$ did not indicate
any particular relationship. Correlations cannot
detect the relationship between the $x$ and $y$ because the correlation technique confounds
phenomena occurring on different
timescales. Spatial wavelet coherence revealed a highly significant relationship
at periods around $12$ years (g) and on
average over long timescales (left $P$-value on panel g, long timescales
defined as $>4$ years) but no relationship
(right $P$-value) for short timescales ($<4$ years). The red line on g is the
spatial wavelet coherence and black lines are
$50$th, $95$th, and $99$th percentiles of spatial wavelet coherences
of synchrony-preserving surrogate (randomized) data sets (SI section \ref{SI:methods}; Sheppard \emph{et al.} 2016)
appropriately representing the
null hypothesis of no relationship between the $x$ and $y$.
Also see SI section \ref{SI:methods} and Sheppard \emph{et al.} (2016) for a description of how the aggregate long- and short-timescale $P$-values were computed. \label{PedagogFigSpatCoh}}

the synchrony, and state-total time series (J-L) showing the large-spatial-scale cycling that is the result of synchrony. 
Left panels were produced
exactly as in scenarios 2 and 3 of Fig. \ref{MT-Fig1_example}, but using a periodicity $w=5$ of the synchronous component
of the environmental time series. As in Fig. \ref{MT-Fig1_example}, the weak and not visually obvious $5$-year syncrony in the 
environmental time series of (A) produced likewise weak $5$-year synchrony in model population time series (B, C), which, in spite
of its weakness, resulted in  a substantial $5$-year-period cycle when time series were summed. Likewise, and as explained
in detail in the main text, snow depth and $\text{MEI}_{\text{w}}$ (B) produced a combined Moran effect on deer (E), which caused 
synchrony in deer (H) on about $5$-year timescales ($3-7$-years), thereby resulting a substantial deer cycle on 
statewide spatial scales (K). Also as explained in detail in the main text, deer abundance (C) produced a Moran effect
on DVCs (F), which caused synchrony in DVCs (I) on $3-7$-year timescales, thereby resulting in a DVC cycle on statewide
spatial scales (L). Some horizontal and vertical axis extents differ among the three cases considered
because available time series were shorter for DVCs
than for deer. Panels (K) and (L) show state-total time series with linear (K) and nonlinear (L) trends removed, as explained
in the main text. Middle and right panels reproduce information from the main text figures exactly, and are reproduced 
here in summary format solely to facilitate comparison with theoretical results. \label{PedagogEmp_Fig}}
